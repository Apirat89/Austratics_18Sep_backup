        "message": "The Aged Care Act ensures quality of care through several mechanisms:\n\n1.  **Aged Care Act 1997**\n    1.  The Act is the main law that covers government-funded aged care, including:\n        1.  eligibility\n        2.  funding\n        3.  regulation\n        4.  approval of providers\n        5.  subsidies and fees\n        6.  standards\n        7.  quality of care\n        8.  rights of people receiving care\n        9.  non-compliance [the-australian-national-aged-care-classification-an-acc-funding-guide_0, Section 11.1, Page 51]\n        [the-australian-national-aged-care-classification-an-acc-funding-guide_0, Section 11.1, Page 51]\n\n2.  **Quality of Care Principles 2014**\n    1.  There is a suite of principles that sit under the Act providing more detail on these rules, including the Quality of Care Principles 2014 (the Principles). [the-australian-national-aged-care-classification-an-acc-funding-guide_0, Section 11.1, Page 51]\n        [the-australian-national-aged-care-classification-an-acc-funding-guide_0, Section 11.1, Page 51]\n    2.  The Principles set out the responsibilities of approved providers in providing residential and home care services. [the-australian-national-aged-care-classification-an-acc-funding-guide_0, Section 11.1, Page 51]\n        [the-australian-national-aged-care-classification-an-acc-funding-guide_0, Section 11.1, Page 51]\n\n3.  **Aged Care Quality Standards**\n    1.  Approved providers are required to provide services to residents in accordance with their obligations under the Aged Care Act 1997 (the Act) and the associated Aged Care Quality Standards ( Quality Standards). [the-australian-national-aged-care-classification-an-acc-funding-guide_0, Section 11.1, Page 51]\n        [the-australian-national-aged-care-classification-an-acc-funding-guide_0, Section 11.1, Page 51]\n    2.  The rules may prescribe standards relating to the quality of funded aged care services delivered by a registered provider. [C2024A00104REC01, Section 15(1), Page 146]\n        [C2024A00104REC01, Section 15(1), Page 146]\n    3.  The Aged Care Quality Standards define what good care looks like and reflect the quality of care older people should expect. [aged-care-reforms-a-guide-for-providers-and-the-sector, Page 10]\n    4.  The Quality Standards focus on areas like person-centred care, clinical care, diversity, dementia care, food and nutrition, partnership with older people and provider governance, are user friendly and measurable, use simpler language and reduce duplication, and reference the new Statement of Rights. [aged-care-reforms-a-guide-for-providers-and-the-sector, Page 10]\n    5.  Under the strengthened Quality Standards, providers will receive a graded assessment against each standard to encourage excellence in aged care service delivery. [aged-care-reforms-a-guide-for-providers-and-the-sector, Page 10]\n\n4.  **New Aged Care Act (Exposure Draft)**\n    1.  The new Act will specify the rights of older people who are accessing, or seeking to access, funded aged care services (Chapter 1, Part 3, Division 1). [a-new-aged-care-act-exposure-draft-consultation-paper-no-2, Page 21]\n        [a-new-aged-care-act-exposure-draft-consultation-paper-no-2, Page 21]\n    2.  It also establishes clear standards of care and obligations on registered providers and aged care workers, ensuring that unsafe and poor quality care are never acceptable (Chapter 3). [a-new-aged-care-act-exposure-draft-consultation-paper-no-2, Page 21]\n        [a-new-aged-care-act-exposure-draft-consultation-paper-no-2, Page 21]\n    3.  Embedding the concept of high quality care in the new Act sends a strong message that we want providers and workers to aim higher and not just comply with minimum requirements. [a-new-aged-care-act-exposure-draft-consultation-paper-no-2, Page 21]\n        [a-new-aged-care-act-exposure-draft-consultation-paper-no-2, Page 21]\n    4.  We want them to innovate, continuously improve and strive towards delivery of high quality care at all times, with the support of the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission. [a-new-aged-care-act-exposure-draft-consultation-paper-no-2, Page 21]\n        [a-new-aged-care-act-exposure-draft-consultation-paper-no-2, Page 21]\n\nIn summary, the Aged Care Act ensures quality of care through a multi-faceted approach encompassing the Act itself, the Quality of Care Principles, the Aged Care Quality Standards, and the forthcoming New Aged Care Act, all working in concert to define, regulate, and promote high-quality care for older Australians.\n",

        "message": "The Aged Care Act ensures quality of care through several mechanisms:\n\n1.  **Aged Care Act 1997**\n    1.  The Act is the main law that covers government-funded aged care, including:\n        1.  eligibility\n        2.  funding\n        3.  regulation\n        4.  approval of providers\n        5.  subsidies and fees\n        6.  standards\n        7.  quality of care\n        8.  rights of people receiving care\n        9.  non-compliance [the-australian-national-aged-care-classification-an-acc-funding-guide_0, Section 11.1, Page 51]\n        [the-australian-national-aged-care-classification-an-acc-funding-guide_0, Section 11.1, Page 51]\n\n2.  **Quality of Care Principles 2014**\n    1.  There is a suite of principles that sit under the Act providing more detail on these rules, including the Quality of Care Principles 2014 (the Principles). [the-australian-national-aged-care-classification-an-acc-funding-guide_0, Section 11.1, Page 51]\n        [the-australian-national-aged-care-classification-an-acc-funding-guide_0, Section 11.1, Page 51]\n    2.  The Principles set out the responsibilities of approved providers in providing residential and home care services. [the-australian-national-aged-care-classification-an-acc-funding-guide_0, Section 11.1, Page 51]\n        [the-australian-national-aged-care-classification-an-acc-funding-guide_0, Section 11.1, Page 51]\n\n3.  **Aged Care Quality Standards**\n    1.  Approved providers are required to provide services to residents in accordance with their obligations under the Aged Care Act 1997 (the Act) and the associated Aged Care Quality Standards ( Quality Standards). [the-australian-national-aged-care-classification-an-acc-funding-guide_0, Section 11.1, Page 51]\n        [the-australian-national-aged-care-classification-an-acc-funding-guide_0, Section 11.1, Page 51]\n    2.  The rules may prescribe standards relating to the quality of funded aged care services delivered by a registered provider. [C2024A00104REC01, Section 15(1), Page 146]\n        [C2024A00104REC01, Section 15(1), Page 146]\n    3.  The Aged Care Quality Standards define what good care looks like and reflect the quality of care older people should expect. [aged-care-reforms-a-guide-for-providers-and-the-sector, Page 10]\n    4.  The Quality Standards focus on areas like person-centred care, clinical care, diversity, dementia care, food and nutrition, partnership with older people and provider governance, are user friendly and measurable, use simpler language and reduce duplication, and reference the new Statement of Rights. [aged-care-reforms-a-guide-for-providers-and-the-sector, Page 10]\n    5.  Under the strengthened Quality Standards, providers will receive a graded assessment against each standard to encourage excellence in aged care service delivery. [aged-care-reforms-a-guide-for-providers-and-the-sector, Page 10]\n\n4.  **New Aged Care Act (Exposure Draft)**\n    1.  The new Act will specify the rights of older people who are accessing, or seeking to access, funded aged care services (Chapter 1, Part 3, Division 1). [a-new-aged-care-act-exposure-draft-consultation-paper-no-2, Page 21]\n        [a-new-aged-care-act-exposure-draft-consultation-paper-no-2, Page 21]\n    2.  It also establishes clear standards of care and obligations on registered providers and aged care workers, ensuring that unsafe and poor quality care are never acceptable (Chapter 3). [a-new-aged-care-act-exposure-draft-consultation-paper-no-2, Page 21]\n        [a-new-aged-care-act-exposure-draft-consultation-paper-no-2, Page 21]\n    3.  Embedding the concept of high quality care in the new Act sends a strong message that we want providers and workers to aim higher and not just comply with minimum requirements. [a-new-aged-care-act-exposure-draft-consultation-paper-no-2, Page 21]\n        [a-new-aged-care-act-exposure-draft-consultation-paper-no-2, Page 21]\n    4.  We want them to innovate, continuously improve and strive towards delivery of high quality care at all times, with the support of the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission. [a-new-aged-care-act-exposure-draft-consultation-paper-no-2, Page 21]\n        [a-new-aged-care-act-exposure-draft-consultation-paper-no-2, Page 21]\n\nIn summary, the Aged Care Act ensures quality of care through a multi-faceted approach encompassing the Act itself, the Quality of Care Principles, the Aged Care Quality Standards, and the forthcoming New Aged Care Act, all working in concert to define, regulate, and promote high-quality care for older Australians.\n",
