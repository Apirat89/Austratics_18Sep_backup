# ðŸ¤– Claude Task Master Integration Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Task Master for Our Project?

We've integrated [Claude Task Master](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master) to systematically manage our remaining development tasks. This AI-powered system will help us:

- **Stay Focused**: Get the next logical task based on our current state
- **Track Progress**: Clear visibility into what's done vs. todo  
- **Manage Dependencies**: Understand which tasks block others
- **Maintain Quality**: Systematic approach to testing and deployment

## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

### 1. **Enable Task Master in Cursor**

1. **Add API Keys to MCP Config:**
   - Edit the file `.cursor/mcp.json` we just created
   - Replace the placeholder API keys with your real ones:
     - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Your Claude API key (recommended)
     - `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Your existing Gemini key 
     - `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Optional OpenAI key
     - `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` - Optional for research tasks

2. **Enable in Cursor Settings:**
   - Open Cursor Settings (`Ctrl+Shift+J`)
   - Click on "MCP" tab on the left
   - Toggle ON the "taskmaster-ai" server

### 2. **Initialize Task Master**

In your Cursor AI chat pane, say:
```
Initialize taskmaster-ai in my project
```

### 3. **Configure Models (Optional)**

Tell Task Master which AI models to use:
```
Change the main model to claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, research model to gemini-1.5-pro, and fallback model to gpt-4
```

## ðŸš€ How to Use Task Master

### **Common Commands:**

1. **Parse Our PRD:**
   ```
   Can you parse my PRD at scripts/prd.txt?
   ```

2. **Get Next Task:**
   ```
   What's the next task I should work on?
   ```

3. **Implement a Task:**
   ```
   Can you help me implement task 1? (Domain Registration & DNS Setup)
   ```

4. **Check Progress:**
   ```
   Show me the current task status and what's completed
   ```

5. **Mark Task Complete:**
   ```
   Mark task 1 as completed
   ```

## ðŸ“‹ Our Current Task Priority

Based on our PRD, here's what Task Master will recommend:

### **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL PATH (Must Do First):**
1. **Task 1: Domain Registration** - BLOCKING everything else
2. **Task 2: Email Configuration** - BLOCKING password reset  
3. **Task 3: Email Testing** - Verify functionality

### **ðŸ”’ HIGH PRIORITY (Security & Testing):**
4. **Task 4: Security Testing** - Enterprise requirements
5. **Task 5: Production Setup** - Deployment readiness
6. **Task 6: Edge Cases Testing** - User experience

### **âš¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY (Quality & Performance):**
7. **Task 7: Code Quality** - Testing infrastructure
8. **Task 8: Performance** - Optimization and monitoring

### **ðŸš€ FUTURE (Next Release):**
9. **Task 9: AI Integration** - Gemini chat features
10. **Task 10: Analytics** - MapTiler and dashboards

## ðŸ’¡ Smart Task Management Features

### **Dependency Tracking:**
Task Master understands that:
- Email config depends on domain registration
- Testing depends on email working
- Production depends on all testing passed

### **Context Awareness:**
Task Master knows our:
- Tech stack (Next.js, Supabase, TypeScript)
- Current progress (75% complete)
- Security requirements (4/5 star rating)
- Healthcare compliance needs

### **AI-Powered Suggestions:**
Task Master can:
- Break down large tasks into smaller steps
- Suggest implementation approaches
- Identify potential issues before they happen
- Recommend best practices for healthcare apps

## ðŸŽ¯ Example Workflow

### **Starting Your Work Session:**
```
Hey Task Master, what should I work on today?
```

**Task Master Response:**
> Based on your PRD, you should start with Task 1: Domain Registration. This is blocking your email configuration and password reset functionality. Would you like me to help you with domain registration for agedcareanalytics.com.au?

### **Getting Implementation Help:**
```
Yes, help me implement task 1 step by step
```

**Task Master Response:**
> I'll guide you through domain registration:
> 1. Research Australian domain registrars (.com.au requirements)
> 2. Choose hosting provider with DNS management
> 3. Register the domain
> 4. Configure DNS records
> 
> Let's start with step 1...

### **Tracking Progress:**
```
Mark task 1 as completed and show me what's next
```
