  }
}
```

**Total Statistics:**
- **91 facility fields** with complete statistics
- **2,684 geographic groups** (nationwide + states + postcodes + localities)
- **Achievement percentages** for staffing metrics (added December 2024)

## ðŸ”§ Data Processing History

### Initial Data Setup
- **Source**: Australian government residential aged care dataset (May 2025)
- **Cleaning**: Service name standardization, removal of rating/staffing suffixes
- **Enhancement**: Addition of detailed room cost data and financial metrics

### December 2024 Enhancements

#### 1. Achievement Percentage Calculations
**Date**: December 2024
**Purpose**: Calculate staffing performance metrics

**New Fields Added:**
- `star_[S] Registered Nurse Care Minutes - % Achievement`
- `star_[S] Total Care Minutes - % Achievement`

**Calculation Method:**
```javascript
Achievement % = (Actual Ã· Target) Ã— 100
```

**Process Details:**
- **Data Source**: Existing Target and Actual care minutes fields
- **Processing**: 2,606 facilities processed
- **Results**: 2,521 facilities with calculated percentages, 85 set to null (zero targets)
- **Precision**: Rounded to 1 decimal place
- **Null Handling**: Set to null when target is 0/null/undefined

#### 2. Box Plot Statistics Generation
**Date**: December 2024
**Purpose**: Enable UI box plot comparisons for achievement percentages

**Statistics Calculated:**
- **Min, Q1, Median, Q3, Max** for both new achievement percentage fields
- **Geographic Breakdown**: Nationwide, state, postcode, and locality levels
- **Total Groups**: 2,684 geographic groupings per field

**Process Details:**
- **Null Value Handling**: Excluded from calculations (recommendation: skip nulls for meaningful statistics)
- **Geographic Grouping**: Based on `address_state`, `address_postcode`, `address_locality` fields
- **Precision**: All statistics rounded to 1 decimal place

3. **Update Statistics**: Calculate box plot statistics for new fields across all geographic levels
4. **File Locations**: Update both public (`/public/maps/abs_csv/`) and private (`/Maps_ABS_CSV/`) copies
5. **Documentation**: Update this README with new field details and processing notes

### Data Refresh Process
1. **Source Data**: Obtain updated Australian government dataset
2. **Data Processing**: Apply same cleaning and enhancement procedures
3. **Calculate Achievements**: Re-run achievement percentage calculations
4. **Update Statistics**: Regenerate complete statistics file with new data
5. **Verify UI**: Test residential page functionality with updated data

## ðŸ“Š Data Quality Notes

### Field Coverage
- **91 total fields** per facility record
- **Complete coverage** for core facility information (name, address, ratings)
- **Variable coverage** for optional fields (some facilities may have null values)

### Geographic Distribution
- **Nationwide coverage** across Australian states and territories
- **Urban and rural** facilities included
- **Postcode and locality** data available for geographic analysis

### Achievement Percentage Accuracy
- **Based on official target/actual data** from government reporting
- **Null values represent** facilities with no staffing targets set
- **Range validation**: Achievements can exceed 100% (over-performance) or be below 100% (under-performance)

## ðŸ”§ Technical Specifications

### File Formats
- **JSON**: Human-readable, structured data format
- **UTF-8 Encoding**: Full Unicode character support
- **Pretty Printed**: 2-space indentation for readability

### Performance Considerations
- **File Sizes**: ~2.0MB+ for main data file, larger for statistics file
- **Loading Strategy**: Asynchronous loading recommended for UI integration
- **Caching**: Consider browser/application caching for frequently accessed data

### Backup Strategy
- **Dual Locations**: Public and private copies maintained automatically
- **Version Control**: Git tracking for all changes and updates
