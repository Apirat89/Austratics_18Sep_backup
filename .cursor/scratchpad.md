# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

This is an Aged Care Analytics platform project that was previously managed using Task Master. All tasks have been transferred from the Task Master system to this scratchpad for continued management.

The project is a Next.js application focused on healthcare analytics for the aged care industry in Australia, featuring:
- Interactive data visualizations (deck.gl, ECharts)
- AI-powered chat system with Gemini integration
- Geographic analytics with real aged care facility data
- Advanced security infrastructure
- Multi-tenant enterprise features

## Key Challenges and Analysis

**Critical Production Blockers:**
- Domain registration and email configuration needed for production launch
- Seven-layer security infrastructure gaps must be addressed
- Email allowlist validation system needed for controlled signup access

**Technical Architecture Challenges:**
- Integration of multiple visualization engines (deck.gl for geographic, ECharts for business charts)
- AI chat system requiring healthcare-specific safety filters and HIPAA compliance
- Complex data integration from multiple Australian government datasets
- Performance optimization for large healthcare datasets

**Priority Dependencies:**
- Domain/email setup blocks production launch but can be done in parallel
- Visualization engines are foundational for analytics functionality
- Security infrastructure is critical before any production deployment

- ✅ Ensured proper layer ordering: MapTiler Base → Heatmap → Clickable Boundaries
- ✅ Maintained separate engines with no interaction between layers
- ✅ Build completed successfully with no TypeScript errors
- ✅ Development server running on http://localhost:3000

**✅ COMPLETED:** Data Layers UI/UX Redesign
- ✅ Moved visibility toggle to header (replaced "Health data available" text)
- ✅ Display selected variable name where "Healthcare Heatmap" was shown
- ✅ Show "No selection made" when no variable is selected
- ✅ Added horizontal gradient legend with min/max values at the poles
- ✅ Legend positioned underneath the variable name display area
- ✅ Implemented proper data flow: HeatmapBackgroundLayer → AustralianMap → Maps Page → DataLayers
- ✅ Added callback system to pass min/max values from heatmap calculations
- ✅ Legend automatically appears/disappears based on data availability
- ✅ Clean, modern UI with proper spacing and visual hierarchy
- ✅ All TypeScript interfaces updated with new props
- ✅ Development server running successfully with no compilation errors

**Ready for User Testing:** The redesigned Data Layers UI is now complete and ready for testing at http://localhost:3000/maps

**How to Test the New UI:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/maps
2. Look for "Data Layers" panel in bottom-left corner
3. **NEW:** Notice the visibility toggle (eye icon) is now in the header
4. Click to expand the Data Layers panel
5. **NEW:** See "No selection made" displayed initially
6. Click on "Health" section to see 18 healthcare data categories
7. Select any category (e.g., "Commonwealth Home Support Program - Number of Participants")
8. **NEW:** Selected variable name now displays where "Healthcare Heatmap" was
9. **NEW:** Horizontal gradient legend appears with min/max values
10. Use the header eye toggle to show/hide the heatmap layer
11. **NEW:** Legend disappears when heatmap is hidden
12. Verify heatmap appears as background layer below clickable boundaries
13. Test that boundary interactions still work independently of heatmap

**UI Improvements Delivered:**
- More intuitive visibility control in header
- Clear indication of selected data variable
- Professional gradient legend with value ranges
- Better visual hierarchy and information organization
- Responsive design that adapts to data availability

**✅ COMPLETED:** Heatmap Display Issue Fixed
- ✅ **Root Cause Identified**: Logic error in HeatmapBackgroundLayer component
- ✅ **Problem**: `onMinMaxCalculated(undefined, undefined)` was being called too early in updateHeatmap function
- ✅ **Issue**: The condition `!sa2HeatmapVisibleRef.current || !sa2HeatmapDataRef.current` was clearing min/max values immediately when heatmap visibility was false OR when no data, even if data was being loaded
- ✅ **Fix Applied**: 
  - Removed premature clearing of min/max values in updateHeatmap function
  - Only clear min/max values when there's genuinely no data available (`!sa2HeatmapDataRef.current`)
  - Preserved auto-enable heatmap logic when user selects data
  - Removed premature clearing of min/max values on visibility toggle
- ✅ **Logic Flow Now**: Select Data → Auto-enable Heatmap → Load Data → Calculate Min/Max → Display Legend
- ✅ **Hot Reload**: Changes applied automatically via Next.js development server
- ✅ **Development Server**: Running successfully on http://localhost:3000

**Ready for Testing:** The heatmap display issue is now resolved. The redesigned Data Layers UI with working heatmap functionality is ready for testing at http://localhost:3000/maps

**Test Steps to Verify Fix:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/maps
2. **NEW UI**: Notice the visibility toggle (eye icon) in the Data Layers header
3. Expand the Data Layers panel 
4. **Fixed**: Should show "No selection made" initially
5. Click on "Health" section to see 18 healthcare data categories
6. Select any category (e.g., "Commonwealth Home Support Program - Number of Participants")
7. **Fixed**: Heatmap should auto-enable and become visible
8. **Fixed**: Selected variable name should display correctly
9. **Fixed**: Horizontal gradient legend should appear with proper min/max values
10. **Fixed**: Heatmap should be visible on the map with red color gradients
11. Use the header eye toggle to show/hide the heatmap layer
12. **Fixed**: Legend persists when toggling visibility (only clears when no data)

**Next Steps:** User should test the fixed functionality and confirm the heatmap is now displaying correctly.

**✅ COMPLETED:** Facility Removal Bug Fix
- ✅ **Problem**: Facility "Juniper Numbala Nunga" cannot be removed from saved facilities  
- ✅ **Root Cause**: Inconsistent database search logic between checking saved status vs. removing facilities
- ✅ **Analysis**: 
  - `isSearchSaved()` used: `.or('search_term.eq.${searchTerm},search_display_name.eq.${searchTerm}')`
  - `handleSaveFacility()` removal used: `.eq('search_term', serviceName)` ← Only searched one field
- ✅ **Why This Caused Random Failures**:
  - Some facilities found by `search_display_name` rather than `search_term`
  - Button showed "Remove from Saved" (because `isSearchSaved` found them)
  - But clicking remove failed (because removal logic couldn't find them)
  - Created inconsistent state where facilities appeared saved but couldn't be removed
- ✅ **Fix Applied**: Updated removal logic in AustralianMap.tsx line 544:
  ```typescript
  // OLD (broken):
  .eq('search_term', serviceName)
  
  // NEW (fixed):
  .or(`search_term.eq.${serviceName},search_display_name.eq.${serviceName}`)
  ```
- ✅ **Status**: FIXED - Removal logic now matches checking logic consistently
- ✅ **Hot Reload**: Applied automatically via Next.js development server

**Questions for Planning:**
- Should we prioritize domain registration (Task 1) or security infrastructure (Task 11) first?
- Are there any additional tasks or requirements not captured in the transfer?

## Lessons

### Task Transfer Process
- ✅ Successfully extracted 11 main tasks + 1 specific signup task from Task Master
- ✅ Maintained all task details, priorities, dependencies, and test strategies
- ✅ Organized tasks by priority levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- ✅ Preserved all implementation details and acceptance criteria
- ✅ Completely removed Task Master system (.taskmaster/, tasks/, TASK_MASTER_SETUP.md)
- ✅ Cleaned up MCP server configuration to remove Task Master integration
- ✅ Successfully migrated to scratchpad-based project management

### Project Structure Understanding
- The project uses Next.js with TypeScript
- Heavy focus on data visualization and healthcare analytics
- Multiple AI/ML integration points (Gemini, predictive analytics)
- Strong emphasis on security and compliance (HIPAA)
- Australian market focus with government dataset integration

### Priority Insights
- Production launch is blocked by domain/email setup and security infrastructure
- Visualization engines are foundational and can be developed in parallel
- Data integration and processing is critical for all analytics features
- Enterprise features (multi-tenancy, advanced ML) are lower priority
