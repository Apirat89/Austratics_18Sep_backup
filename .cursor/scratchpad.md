### üÜï **NEW FEATURE PLAN: Top/Bottom Records Panel**

**üéØ FEATURE DESCRIPTION:**
Add a collapsible sidebar panel on the right side of the map that displays the top 3 and bottom 3 SA2 regions when a healthcare variable is selected. The panel should show region names, values, and allow for future expansion with additional analytics.

**üîç CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**
- DataLayers component in bottom-left has healthcare variable selection
- HeatmapDataService processes SA2 healthcare data into SA2HeatmapData format
- Map shows colored heatmap based on selected healthcare variable
- No current mechanism to show ranked data insights

**üìã DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:**

**üîÑ STARTING IMPLEMENTATION:** Top/Bottom Records Panel Feature

**Phase 1: Data Analysis & Preparation - STARTING**
- üîÑ Extending HeatmapDataService.tsx with ranked data calculation
- üîÑ Adding SA2 name lookup using existing boundary cache pattern
- üîÑ Creating RankedSA2Data interface and callback system
- ‚è≥ Testing ranked data calculation with sample healthcare variables

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Following the approved 4-phase plan with SA2 ID + Name display format
- Leveraging existing boundary cache to avoid duplicate 170MB SA2.geojson loads
- Building non-intrusive additions that don't disrupt existing heatmap functionality
- Focus on performance and proper error handling throughout implementation

**Phase 2: Create TopBottomPanel Component**
2. **Create src/components/TopBottomPanel.tsx:**
   - Interface props: `rankedData`, `isVisible`, `onToggle`
   - Positioned absolutely on right side of map container
   - Collapsible with toggle button (ChevronLeft/ChevronRight icon)
   - Only visible when healthcare variable is selected
   - Clean, modern UI matching DataLayers design
   - Show loading state when data is processing
   - Empty state when no variable selected

**Phase 3: Update Maps Page Integration**
3. **Modify src/app/maps/page.tsx:**
   - Add state: `rankedData`, `topBottomPanelVisible`
   - Pass onRankedDataCalculated callback to HeatmapDataService
   - Add TopBottomPanel component to JSX with proper positioning
   - Handle panel visibility logic (auto-show when data available)

**Phase 4: Data Flow Integration**
4. **Update AustralianMap.tsx:**
   - Pass through rankedData callback from maps page to HeatmapDataService
   - Ensure proper prop threading without disrupting existing heatmap logic

**üé® UI/UX SPECIFICATIONS:**

**Panel Design:**
- Fixed position on right side, similar height to DataLayers
- Collapsible with animated slide in/out
- Header with healthcare variable name and collapse toggle
- Two sections: "Highest Values" and "Lowest Values"
- Each section shows 3 cards with SA2 name, value, and rank indicator
- **Display Format:** Region names with SA2 ID in brackets, e.g., "Sydney - Haymarket (105021098)"

**Panel States:**
- Hidden: When no healthcare variable selected
- Loading: When data is being processed
- Populated: When showing top/bottom data
- Collapsed: When user minimizes panel

**Styling:**
- Match DataLayers component color scheme and shadows
- Use Tailwind CSS for consistency
- Icons from lucide-react (TrendingUp, TrendingDown)
- Values formatted with toLocaleString() for readability

**üîÑ DATA FLOW:**
1. User selects healthcare variable in DataLayers
2. HeatmapDataService processes data for heatmap
3. Same service calculates top/bottom rankings with SA2 names
4. Maps page receives ranked data via callback
5. TopBottomPanel receives ranked data and displays insights
6. Panel auto-shows when data available, hides when cleared

**‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- Panel appears only when healthcare variable is selected
- Shows accurate top 3 and bottom 3 regions with correct values
- Panel is collapsible and responsive
- No interference with existing heatmap functionality
- Clean, professional UI that matches existing design
- Loading states and error handling

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION RISKS:**
- **SA2 Boundary Data Size:** SA2.geojson is 170MB - need efficient loading/caching strategy
- Leverage existing boundary cache pattern from HeatmapBackgroundLayer to avoid duplicate loads
- Need to fetch SA2 names (either from boundary GeoJSON or separate lookup)
- Ensure proper cleanup when switching between variables
- Handle edge cases (less than 3 regions with data)
- Maintain performance when processing large datasets
- Potential layout conflicts with existing sidebar components

**üîß TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS:**
- **Shared Data Loading:** Coordinate with HeatmapBackgroundLayer to reuse SA2 boundary cache
- **Memory Management:** Extract only SA2 ID‚ÜíName mapping from 170MB GeoJSON, don't store full boundary data twice
- **Loading States:** Handle async SA2 name lookup gracefully with proper loading indicators
- **Performance:** Cache SA2 name mapping separately from full boundary data for fast access

**üß™ TESTING STRATEGY:**
- Test with different healthcare variables
- Verify rankings are mathematically correct
- Test collapsible functionality
- Verify no layout breaking on different screen sizes
- Test edge cases (no data, single region, etc.)
- Ensure proper cleanup when variable selection changes

**Ready for User Testing:** The redesigned Data Layers UI is now complete and ready for testing at http://localhost:3000/maps

**How to Test the New UI:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/maps
2. Look for "Data Layers" panel in bottom-left corner
3. **NEW:** Notice the visibility toggle (eye icon) is now in the header
4. Click to expand the Data Layers panel
5. **NEW:** See "No selection made" displayed initially
6. Click on "Health" section to see 18 healthcare data categories
7. Select any category (e.g., "Commonwealth Home Support Program - Number of Participants")
8. **NEW:** Selected variable name now displays where "Healthcare Heatmap" was
9. **NEW:** Horizontal gradient legend appears with min/max values
10. Use the header eye toggle to show/hide the heatmap layer
11. **NEW:** Legend disappears when heatmap is hidden
12. Verify heatmap appears as background layer below clickable boundaries
13. Test that boundary interactions still work independently of heatmap

**UI Improvements Delivered:**
- More intuitive visibility control in header
- Clear indication of selected data variable
- Professional gradient legend with value ranges
- Better visual hierarchy and information organization
- Responsive design that adapts to data availability

**‚úÖ COMPLETED:** Heatmap Display Issue Fixed
- ‚úÖ **Root Cause Identified**: Logic error in HeatmapBackgroundLayer component
- ‚úÖ **Problem**: `onMinMaxCalculated(undefined, undefined)` was being called too early in updateHeatmap function
- ‚úÖ **Issue**: The condition `!sa2HeatmapVisibleRef.current || !sa2HeatmapDataRef.current` was clearing min/max values immediately when heatmap visibility was false OR when no data, even if data was being loaded
- ‚úÖ **Fix Applied**: 
  - Removed premature clearing of min/max values in updateHeatmap function
  - Only clear min/max values when there's genuinely no data available (`!sa2HeatmapDataRef.current`)
  - Preserved auto-enable heatmap logic when user selects data
  - Removed premature clearing of min/max values on visibility toggle
- ‚úÖ **Logic Flow Now**: Select Data ‚Üí Auto-enable Heatmap ‚Üí Load Data ‚Üí Calculate Min/Max ‚Üí Display Legend
- ‚úÖ **Hot Reload**: Changes applied automatically via Next.js development server
- ‚úÖ **Development Server**: Running successfully on http://localhost:3000

**Ready for Testing:** The heatmap display issue is now resolved. The redesigned Data Layers UI with working heatmap functionality is ready for testing at http://localhost:3000/maps

**Test Steps to Verify Fix:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/maps
2. **NEW UI**: Notice the visibility toggle (eye icon) in the Data Layers header
3. Expand the Data Layers panel 
4. **Fixed**: Should show "No selection made" initially
5. Click on "Health" section to see 18 healthcare data categories
6. Select any category (e.g., "Commonwealth Home Support Program - Number of Participants")
7. **Fixed**: Heatmap should auto-enable and become visible
8. **Fixed**: Selected variable name should display correctly
9. **Fixed**: Horizontal gradient legend should appear with proper min/max values
10. **Fixed**: Heatmap should be visible on the map with red color gradients
11. Use the header eye toggle to show/hide the heatmap layer
12. **Fixed**: Legend persists when toggling visibility (only clears when no data)

**Next Steps:** User should test the fixed functionality and confirm the heatmap is now displaying correctly.

**‚úÖ COMPLETED:** Facility Removal Bug Fix
- ‚úÖ **Problem**: Facility "Juniper Numbala Nunga" cannot be removed from saved facilities  
- ‚úÖ **Root Cause**: Inconsistent database search logic between checking saved status vs. removing facilities
- ‚úÖ **Analysis**: 
  - `isSearchSaved()` used: `.or('search_term.eq.${searchTerm},search_display_name.eq.${searchTerm}')`
  - `handleSaveFacility()` removal used: `.eq('search_term', serviceName)` ‚Üê Only searched one field
- ‚úÖ **Why This Caused Random Failures**:
  - Some facilities found by `search_display_name` rather than `search_term`
  - Button showed "Remove from Saved" (because `isSearchSaved` found them)
  - But clicking remove failed (because removal logic couldn't find them)
  - Created inconsistent state where facilities appeared saved but couldn't be removed
- ‚úÖ **Fix Applied**: Updated removal logic in AustralianMap.tsx line 544:
  ```typescript
  // OLD (broken):
  .eq('search_term', serviceName)
  
  // NEW (fixed):
  .or(`search_term.eq.${serviceName},search_display_name.eq.${serviceName}`)
  ```
- ‚úÖ **Status**: FIXED - Removal logic now matches checking logic consistently
- ‚úÖ **Hot Reload**: Applied automatically via Next.js development server

**Questions for Planning:**
- Should we prioritize domain registration (Task 1) or security infrastructure (Task 11) first?
- Are there any additional tasks or requirements not captured in the transfer?
