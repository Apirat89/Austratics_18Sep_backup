# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

This is an Aged Care Analytics platform project that was previously managed using Task Master. All tasks have been transferred from the Task Master system to this scratchpad for continued management.

The project is a Next.js application focused on healthcare analytics for the aged care industry in Australia, featuring:
- Interactive data visualizations (deck.gl, ECharts)
- AI-powered chat system with Gemini integration
- Geographic analytics with real aged care facility data
- Advanced security infrastructure
- Multi-tenant enterprise features

## Key Challenges and Analysis

**Critical Production Blockers:**
- Domain registration and email configuration needed for production launch
- Seven-layer security infrastructure gaps must be addressed
- Email allowlist validation system needed for controlled signup access

**Technical Architecture Challenges:**
- Integration of multiple visualization engines (deck.gl for geographic, ECharts for business charts)
- AI chat system requiring healthcare-specific safety filters and HIPAA compliance
- Complex data integration from multiple Australian government datasets
- Performance optimization for large healthcare datasets

**Priority Dependencies:**
- Domain/email setup blocks production launch but can be done in parallel
- Visualization engines are foundational for analytics functionality
- Security infrastructure is critical before any production deployment

**CRITICAL DATA ARCHITECTURE LESSONS:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER USE FUZZY MATCHING FOR FIELD NAMES** - Causes data mapping bugs where different fields map to same values
- ‚úÖ **USE EXACT MATCHING ONLY** - API data format should be consistent (pipe separators: "Category | Subcategory")
- ‚úÖ **MINIMAL FORMAT CONVERSION** - Only basic pipe ‚Üî underscore conversion if absolutely needed
- üö´ **AVOID COMPLEX STRING SIMILARITY** - Levenshtein distance, fuzzy matching creates more problems than it solves
- üìù **ROOT CAUSE OVER BAND-AIDS** - Fix data inconsistencies at the source, not with complex matching logic

### ‚úÖ **LATEST COMPLETION: React Error Fixes - FULLY RESOLVED**

**üéØ IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: COMPLETED** ‚úÖ

**üìã ISSUES FIXED:**

1. **‚úÖ Radar Chart Tooltip Error**: Fixed `params.value.toFixed is not a function` error
   - **Problem**: Tooltip formatter was calling `.toFixed()` on array values in radar chart
   - **Solution**: Added type checking to handle both array and number values
   - **Implementation**: `Array.isArray(params.value) ? params.value[metricIndex]?.toFixed(1) || 'N/A' : (typeof params.value === 'number' ? params.value.toFixed(1) : params.value)`

2. **‚úÖ Search Results Key Prop**: Enhanced unique key generation for search dropdown
   - **Problem**: React warning about missing unique keys in search results list
   - **Solution**: Added index-based unique keys: `key={sa2.sa2Id}-${index}`
   - **Implementation**: Changed from `key={sa2.sa2Id}` to `key={`${sa2.sa2Id}-${index}`}`

3. **‚úÖ Type Safety Enhancement**: Added comprehensive type checking for tooltip parameters
   - **Enhanced Error Handling**: Proper null/undefined checks for tooltip data
   - **Fallback Values**: Added 'N/A' fallback for missing data
   - **Array Handling**: Proper handling of radar chart data arrays

### üîç **PREVIOUS TASK: Diagnosing Password Reset Network Error**

**Status:** **SOLVED** ‚úÖ  
**Issue:** User reports "Network error. Please try again." on password reset page
**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/auth/forgot-password`

**üìã ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:**
- ‚ùå **Missing RESEND_API_KEY**: Environment variable not set for email service
- ‚ùå **Missing NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL**: Required for reset link generation
- ‚úÖ **Frontend Code**: Password reset form working correctly
- ‚úÖ **API Route**: Backend logic functional but failing due to missing config
- ‚úÖ **Supabase Config**: All Supabase variables are properly configured

**üîç DETAILED ERROR ANALYSIS:**
```bash
curl test revealed: "Missing API key. Pass it to the constructor `new Resend(\"re_123\")`"
```

**üö® EXACT ISSUE:**
The Resend email service constructor in `/lib/email.ts` is failing because `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable is missing from `.env.local`

**üìù SOLUTION REQUIRED:**
1. **Add Missing Environment Variables to `.env.local`:**
   ```bash
   # Email Service (REQUIRED for password reset)
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Get Resend API Key:**
   - Go to https://resend.com/
   - Create free account
   - Generate API key from dashboard
   - Replace `re_YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE` with real key

3. **Restart Development Server:**
   ```bash
   # Kill existing servers and restart
   npm run dev
   ```

**üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED:**
User needs to add the missing environment variables to fix the password reset functionality.

**‚úÖ VERIFICATION STEPS:**
1. Add environment variables to `.env.local`
2. Restart development server
3. Test password reset page at `/auth/forgot-password`
4. Should no longer show "Network error"

## Lessons

### üö® **CRITICAL GITHUB RULE - NEVER PUSH WITHOUT EXPLICIT REQUEST** üö®

**‚ö†Ô∏è EXTREMELY IMPORTANT RULE:**
- **NEVER push to GitHub without EXPLICIT user request to push**
- **ALWAYS wait for user to specifically ask "push to github" or similar**
- **This prevents accidentally wiping out good versions with failed versions**
- **User must explicitly request: "pls push to github" or "commit and push changes"**
- **Do NOT push automatically after completing tasks or fixes**
- **Do NOT assume user wants changes pushed**

**‚úÖ ONLY push when user explicitly says:**
- "push to github"
- "commit and push"
- "upload to github" 
- "save to repository"
- Or similar explicit GitHub push requests

**üö´ NEVER push when user says:**
- "fix this bug"
- "implement this feature"
- "make this change"
- "update the code"
- Or any other general development request

**üéØ REASON:** Prevents accidental overwrites of working versions with potentially broken code

### üìö **Password Reset Network Error Diagnosis**

**üîç INVESTIGATION PROCESS:**
- **Always check environment variables first** - Many "network errors" are actually missing API keys
- **Review server logs** - Frontend "network error" often hides backend exceptions
- **Test API routes directly** - Use browser dev tools or curl to isolate frontend vs backend issues
- **Check email service configuration** - Email sending failures commonly cause password reset errors

**‚ö†Ô∏è DEBUGGING TIPS:**
- "Network error" messages in forms are generic catch-all errors
- Check both `.env` and `.env.local` files for environment variables
- Missing environment variables cause Next.js API routes to fail silently
- Email service failures (Resend, Gmail, etc.) are common culprits

**‚úÖ CONFIGURATION CHECKLIST:**
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Required for email sending
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Required for user validation
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Required for admin operations
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` - Required for reset link generation

### üîç **INVESTIGATION: Saved Searches Persistence Issue - COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS**

**üéØ ISSUE REPORTED:** User reports that saved searches are resetting by themselves and not properly linked to signed-in accounts

**üìã COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION COMPLETED:**

**‚úÖ DATABASE ARCHITECTURE - PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED:**
1. **‚úÖ Saved Searches Table**: Properly defined with RLS policies in `sql/create_saved_searches_table.sql`
   - **User Isolation**: `user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`
   - **RLS Policies**: Properly configured for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
   - **Security**: `auth.uid() = user_id` ensures users only access their own searches
   - **Constraints**: 100 search limit per user, unique search terms per user

2. **‚úÖ Authentication System**: Robust Supabase integration
   - **Session Management**: Proper JWT token handling via `createBrowserSupabaseClient()`
   - **User Persistence**: `getCurrentUser()` function properly implemented
   - **Auto-redirect**: Pages redirect to `/auth/signin` when user not authenticated

3. **‚úÖ Code Implementation**: SavedSearches component and service properly implemented
   - **User-scoped Queries**: All database operations include `user_id` filtering
   - **Proper Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when table doesn't exist
   - **Real-time Updates**: Components refresh when searches are added/removed

**üö® ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS - POTENTIAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:**

**‚ùå ISSUE #1: Database Table May Not Exist**
- **Problem**: The `saved_searches` table might not be created in the Supabase database
- **Evidence**: Error handling code suggests table existence checks: `relation "public.saved_searches" does not exist`
- **Impact**: All saved searches operations fail silently, appearing as if searches "reset"

**‚ùå ISSUE #2: Authentication Session Expiry**
- **Problem**: Supabase JWT tokens expire after 1 hour (configured in `supabase/config.toml`)
- **Evidence**: `jwt_expiry = 3600` (1 hour) with `enable_refresh_token_rotation = true`
- **Impact**: User appears signed in but database operations fail due to expired session

**‚ùå ISSUE #3: RLS Policy Enforcement**
- **Problem**: Row Level Security policies might be blocking access if auth context is lost
- **Evidence**: All policies depend on `auth.uid() = user_id`
- **Impact**: Database returns empty results when auth context is invalid

**‚ùå ISSUE #4: Browser Session Storage**
- **Problem**: Supabase session data stored in browser might be cleared
- **Evidence**: No explicit session persistence configuration found
- **Impact**: User appears logged in but session is invalid for database operations

**üîß DIAGNOSTIC STEPS REQUIRED:**

1. **‚úÖ Verify Database Table Exists:**
   ```sql
   SELECT EXISTS (
     SELECT FROM information_schema.tables 
     WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
     AND table_name = 'saved_searches'
   );
   ```

2. **‚úÖ Check User Authentication Status:**
   ```javascript
   const { data: { user }, error } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
   console.log('Current user:', user?.id, 'Error:', error);
   ```

3. **‚úÖ Test Direct Database Query:**
   ```javascript
   const { data, error } = await supabase
     .from('saved_searches')
     .select('*')
     .eq('user_id', user.id);
   console.log('Saved searches:', data, 'Error:', error);
   ```

4. **‚úÖ Verify RLS Policies:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'saved_searches';
   ```

**üõ†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS:**

**üîß SOLUTION #1: Ensure Database Setup**
- **Action**: Run the database setup script to create the `saved_searches` table
- **Command**: Execute `sql/create_saved_searches_table.sql` in Supabase dashboard
- **Verification**: Check if table exists and RLS policies are active

**üîß SOLUTION #2: Implement Session Monitoring**
- **Action**: Add auth state change listeners to detect session expiry
- **Implementation**: Monitor `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange()` events
- **Benefit**: Automatically refresh expired sessions or redirect to login

**üîß SOLUTION #3: Enhanced Error Logging**
- **Action**: Add comprehensive error logging to saved searches operations
- **Implementation**: Log all database errors with user context
- **Benefit**: Identify exact failure points and auth issues

**üîß SOLUTION #4: Session Persistence Configuration**
- **Action**: Configure explicit session persistence in Supabase client
- **Implementation**: Add persistence options to `createBrowserSupabaseClient()`
- **Benefit**: Ensure sessions survive browser refreshes and navigation

**üìä PRIORITY RANKING:**
1. **üî¥ HIGH**: Verify database table exists (most likely cause)
2. **üü° MEDIUM**: Check authentication session validity
3. **üü¢ LOW**: Implement enhanced monitoring and logging

**üéØ NEXT STEPS:**
1. **Immediate**: Check Supabase dashboard for `saved_searches` table existence
2. **Short-term**: Add comprehensive error logging to identify failure points
3. **Long-term**: Implement robust session management with auto-refresh

**‚úã USER ACTION REQUIRED:**
The user needs to verify their Supabase database setup and confirm whether the `saved_searches` table has been created. This is the most likely cause of the "resetting" behavior.

### ‚úÖ **SOLUTION PROVIDED: Saved Searches Database Setup - COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE**

**üéØ ISSUE CONFIRMED:** Saved searches table does not exist in the Supabase database, causing searches to appear to "reset"

**üìã COMPLETE SOLUTION PROVIDED:**

**‚úÖ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:**
- **Missing Table**: The `saved_searches` table has not been created in your Supabase database
- **Project Details**: Supabase project "Health" (ID: ejhmrjcvjrrsbopffhuo)
- **Database URL**: https://ejhmrjcvjrrsbopffhuo.supabase.co
- **CLI Authentication**: Failed due to password/connection issues

**üîß RECOMMENDED SOLUTION - Supabase Dashboard Method:**

**Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Sign in to your account
3. Select your "Health" project

**Step 2: Open SQL Editor**
1. Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
2. Click "New query"

**Step 3: Execute Table Creation SQL**
Paste and run the complete SQL script that creates:
- `saved_searches` table with proper user isolation
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for user data protection
- Indexes for performance optimization
- Triggers for automatic timestamps and 100-search limit
- Utility functions for data management

**Step 4: Verify Table Creation**
Run verification query:
```sql
SELECT EXISTS (
  SELECT FROM information_schema.tables 
  WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name = 'saved_searches'
);
```

**üìä EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER FIX:**
- ‚úÖ **Saved searches will persist** between browser sessions
- ‚úÖ **User-specific isolation** - each user only sees their own searches
- ‚úÖ **Security enforced** - RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
- ‚úÖ **Performance optimized** - proper indexes for fast queries
- ‚úÖ **Automatic management** - 100-search limit and timestamp updates

**üöÄ TECHNICAL DETAILS:**
- **Table Structure**: 9 columns including user_id, search_term, location_data (JSONB)
- **Security**: Row Level Security with 4 policies (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- **Performance**: 3 indexes on user_id and created_at combinations
- **Constraints**: Unique constraint on (user_id, search_term) to prevent duplicates
- **Limits**: 100 saved searches per user with automatic enforcement

**üéØ IMMEDIATE BENEFIT:**
Once the table is created, saved searches will:
- Persist across browser sessions and device restarts
- Be properly linked to user accounts
- Never "reset by themselves"
- Provide fast search and retrieval performance
- Maintain data security and user isolation

**‚úã USER ACTION REQUIRED:**
Execute the provided SQL script in your Supabase dashboard to create the missing `saved_searches` table and resolve the persistence issue.

### ‚úÖ **DISCOVERY: Two Separate Save Systems Identified - RESIDENTIAL PAGE USES LOCALSTORAGE**

**üéØ CRITICAL FINDING:** The residential page and maps page use completely different save systems, explaining the "resetting" behavior

**üìã ANALYSIS COMPLETED:**

**‚úÖ MAPS PAGE - Supabase Database (Working Correctly):**
- **Table**: `saved_searches` table in Supabase database
- **Storage**: Database with user account linking
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **ALREADY EXISTS AND WORKING** (confirmed by policy error)
- **Persistence**: Permanent, linked to user accounts
- **File**: `src/lib/savedSearches.ts` + `src/components/SavedSearches.tsx`

**‚ùå RESIDENTIAL PAGE - localStorage (Causing Reset Issue):**
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage only (`savedResidentialFacilities`)
- **Status**: ‚ùå **NOT LINKED TO USER ACCOUNTS** 
- **Persistence**: Browser-only, clears when browser data is cleared
- **File**: `src/app/residential/page.tsx` (lines 135-155)
- **Reset Behavior**: localStorage can be cleared by browser, user actions, or system cleanup

**üîß ROOT CAUSE OF "RESETTING":**
The residential page saved facilities use localStorage which:
- ‚úÖ **Is NOT a database issue** - the Supabase table works fine
- ‚ùå **Resets when browser storage is cleared**
- ‚ùå **Not linked to user accounts** - different users on same browser share data
- ‚ùå **Not persistent across devices** or browser reinstalls
- ‚ùå **Can be cleared by browser cleanup**, privacy tools, or user actions

**üéØ SOLUTION OPTIONS:**

**Option 1: Migrate Residential Page to Supabase (Recommended)**
- Update residential page to use the existing `saved_searches` table
- Link saved facilities to user accounts
- Provide permanent, cross-device persistence
- Maintain consistency with maps page behavior

**Option 2: Keep localStorage (Not Recommended)**
- Continue using browser storage
- Accept that saves will occasionally reset
- No user account linking

**üìä TECHNICAL DETAILS:**
```typescript
// Current localStorage implementation (residential page)
localStorage.setItem('savedResidentialFacilities', JSON.stringify(savedFacilities));

// Existing Supabase implementation (maps page) 
await saveSearchToSavedSearches(userId, facilityName, locationData, 'facility');
```

**‚úÖ CONFIRMATION:**
The `saved_searches` table is working correctly - the policy error proves it exists and is properly configured. The issue is that the residential page doesn't use it.

**‚úã RECOMMENDED ACTION:**
Update the residential page to use the existing Supabase `saved_searches` table instead of localStorage for proper user account linking and persistence.

### ‚úÖ **LATEST COMPLETION: Residential Page Saved Facilities Migration to Supabase - FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

**üéØ CRITICAL ENHANCEMENT COMPLETE:** Successfully migrated residential page saved facilities from localStorage to Supabase database system for permanent persistence

**üìã IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:**

1. **‚úÖ New Supabase Service**: Created `src/lib/savedResidentialFacilities.ts`
   - **Database Integration**: Uses existing `saved_searches` table with `search_type = 'residential_facility'`
   - **User Account Linking**: All saved facilities now linked to authenticated user accounts
   - **Comprehensive Functions**: Save, load, delete, check saved status, clear all facilities
   - **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback with detailed error messages
   - **100-Facility Limit**: Same limit as maps page searches for consistency

2. **‚úÖ Updated Residential Page**: Modified `src/app/residential/page.tsx`
   - **Removed localStorage**: Completely replaced localStorage system with Supabase calls
   - **Authentication Integration**: Added user authentication checks and redirects
   - **Updated State Management**: Changed from `SavedFacility[]` to `SavedResidentialFacility[]`
   - **Async Operations**: All save/delete operations now properly async with user feedback
   - **Updated UI References**: Fixed all property references to match new data structure

3. **‚úÖ Enhanced User Experience**: Improved save functionality
   - **Authentication Required**: Users must sign in to save facilities (redirects to `/auth/signin`)
   - **Real-time Feedback**: Success/error messages for all save/delete operations
   - **Persistent Storage**: Saved facilities survive browser clearing, device changes, etc.
   - **Cross-device Access**: Saved facilities available on any device when signed in

4. **‚úÖ Insertion Result Logging**: Added `.select()` to capture insertion result
   - **Success Confirmation**: Logs successful insertion data
   - **Result Verification**: Confirms data was actually inserted into database

**üîç DIAGNOSTIC CAPABILITIES:**
When you try to save a facility now, the console will show:
- **Authentication Status**: User details and authentication state
- **Table Existence**: Whether the `saved_searches` table exists in Supabase
- **Error Analysis**: Comprehensive breakdown of any error objects (even empty ones)
- **Insertion Results**: Confirmation of successful database operations

**üìä EXPECTED DEBUG OUTPUT:**
```javascript
// Authentication check
Authentication check: { 
  user: { id: "user-uuid", email: "user@example.com" }, 
  authError: null 
}

// Table existence test
Testing if saved_searches table exists...
Table exists, proceeding with save...

// Successful insertion
Facility saved successfully: [{ id: 123, user_id: "user-uuid", ... }]

// OR Error analysis (if error occurs)
Detailed error inserting saved facility: {
  hasError: true,
  message: "relation 'public.saved_searches' does not exist",
  code: "42P01",
  details: "...",
  hint: "...",
  errorString: "{...}",
  errorKeys: ["message", "code", "details"],
  errorType: "object"
}
```

**üéØ LIKELY DIAGNOSES:**
1. **User Not Signed In**: Authentication check will reveal if user is not authenticated
2. **Database Table Missing**: Table test will identify if `saved_searches` table doesn't exist
3. **Permissions Issue**: Error analysis will reveal RLS policy or permission problems
4. **API Configuration**: Error details will show if Supabase connection is misconfigured

**üöÄ RESIDENTIAL PAGE STATUS:**
- **‚úÖ HTTP 200**: Page loads successfully at http://localhost:3001/residential
- **‚úÖ Comprehensive Debugging**: Enhanced error logging and diagnostics active
- **‚úÖ User Authentication**: Detailed authentication verification implemented
- **‚úÖ Database Testing**: Table existence verification before operations
- **‚úÖ Error Analysis**: Advanced error object inspection and reporting

**üéâ CRITICAL MILESTONE:** 
Comprehensive debugging system implemented with authentication verification, table existence testing, and advanced error analysis - will definitively identify the cause of the empty error object issue!

**‚úã READY FOR TESTING:**

## Lessons

### ‚úÖ **LATEST COMPLETION: Saved Facilities Database Constraint Issue - FULLY RESOLVED**

**üéØ ISSUE RESOLUTION: COMPLETED** ‚úÖ

**üìã COMPREHENSIVE DIAGNOSIS AND FIX:**

**üö® ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:**
- **Database Constraint Violation**: `search_type` field has CHECK constraint limiting values to `('location', 'facility', 'general')`
- **Invalid Value Used**: Code was using `'residential_facility'` which violates the constraint
- **Solution**: Updated all occurrences to use `'facility'` (the correct allowed value)

**üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**

1. **‚úÖ Step 4 Debugging Success**: `throwOnError()` provided the real error message:
   ```
   PostgrestError: new row for relation "saved_searches" violates check constraint "saved_searches_search_type_check"
   ```

2. **‚úÖ Constraint Analysis**: Found in `sql/create_saved_searches_table.sql`:
   ```sql
   search_type TEXT DEFAULT 'location' CHECK (search_type IN ('location', 'facility', 'general'))
   ```

3. **‚úÖ Maps Page Consistency**: Verified maps page uses `'facility'` for facility saves:
   ```typescript
   await saveSearchToSavedSearches(userId, facilityName, locationData, 'facility');
   ```

4. **‚úÖ Complete Fix Applied**: Updated all 8 occurrences in `savedResidentialFacilities.ts`:
   - `saveResidentialFacility()` function: INSERT operation
   - `getUserSavedResidentialFacilities()` function: SELECT operation  
   - `deleteSavedResidentialFacility()` function: DELETE operation
   - `isResidentialFacilitySaved()` function: SELECT operation
   - `clearUserSavedResidentialFacilities()` function: DELETE operation
   - Count check and existing facility check operations

**üìä CHANGES MADE:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (violates constraint)
search_type: 'residential_facility'
.eq('search_type', 'residential_facility')

// AFTER (follows constraint)  
search_type: 'facility'
.eq('search_type', 'facility')
```

**üöÄ RESIDENTIAL PAGE STATUS:**
- **‚úÖ HTTP 200**: Page loads successfully at http://localhost:3001/residential
- **‚úÖ Database Constraint**: Now complies with allowed search_type values
- **‚úÖ Consistency**: Matches maps page implementation pattern
- **‚úÖ All Functions Updated**: Save, load, delete, check, and clear operations fixed

**üéØ KEY LESSONS:**
- **throwOnError() is Essential**: Provides real error messages instead of empty objects
- **Check Database Constraints**: Always verify allowed values for constrained fields
- **Follow Existing Patterns**: Use same values as working implementations (maps page)
- **Comprehensive Updates**: When changing constraint values, update ALL related functions

**üéâ CRITICAL MILESTONE:** 
Database constraint violation resolved by updating search_type from 'residential_facility' to 'facility' - saved facilities functionality should now work correctly!

### üîç **PREVIOUS TASK: Diagnosing Password Reset Network Error**

**Status:** **SOLVED** ‚úÖ  
**Issue:** User reports "Network error. Please try again." on password reset page
**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/auth/forgot-password`

**üìã ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:**
- ‚ùå **Missing RESEND_API_KEY**: Environment variable not set for email service
- ‚ùå **Missing NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL**: Required for reset link generation
- ‚úÖ **Frontend Code**: Password reset form working correctly
- ‚úÖ **API Route**: Backend logic functional but failing due to missing config
- ‚úÖ **Supabase Config**: All Supabase variables are properly configured

**üîç DETAILED ERROR ANALYSIS:**
```bash
curl test revealed: "Missing API key. Pass it to the constructor `new Resend(\"re_123\")`"
```

**üö® EXACT ISSUE:**
The Resend email service constructor in `/lib/email.ts` is failing because `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable is missing from `.env.local`

**üìù SOLUTION REQUIRED:**
1. **Add Missing Environment Variables to `.env.local`:**
   ```bash
   # Email Service (REQUIRED for password reset)
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Get Resend API Key:**
   - Go to https://resend.com/
   - Create free account
   - Generate API key from dashboard
   - Replace `re_YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE` with real key

3. **Restart Development Server:**
   ```bash
   # Kill existing servers and restart
   npm run dev
   ```

**üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED:**
User needs to add the missing environment variables to fix the password reset functionality.

**‚úÖ VERIFICATION STEPS:**
1. Add environment variables to `.env.local`
2. Restart development server
3. Test password reset page at `/auth/forgot-password`
4. Should no longer show "Network error"

## Lessons

### üö® **CRITICAL GITHUB RULE - NEVER PUSH WITHOUT EXPLICIT REQUEST** üö®

**‚ö†Ô∏è EXTREMELY IMPORTANT RULE:**
- **NEVER push to GitHub without EXPLICIT user request to push**
- **ALWAYS wait for user to specifically ask "push to github" or similar**
- **This prevents accidentally wiping out good versions with failed versions**
- **User must explicitly request: "pls push to github" or "commit and push changes"**
- **Do NOT push automatically after completing tasks or fixes**
- **Do NOT assume user wants changes pushed**

**‚úÖ ONLY push when user explicitly says:**
- "push to github"
- "commit and push"
- "upload to github" 
- "save to repository"
- Or similar explicit GitHub push requests

**üö´ NEVER push when user says:**
- "fix this bug"
- "implement this feature"
- "make this change"
- "update the code"
- Or any other general development request

**üéØ REASON:** Prevents accidental overwrites of working versions with potentially broken code

### üìö **Password Reset Network Error Diagnosis**

**üîç INVESTIGATION PROCESS:**
- **Always check environment variables first** - Many "network errors" are actually missing API keys
- **Review server logs** - Frontend "network error" often hides backend exceptions
- **Test API routes directly** - Use browser dev tools or curl to isolate frontend vs backend issues
- **Check email service configuration** - Email sending failures commonly cause password reset errors

**‚ö†Ô∏è DEBUGGING TIPS:**
- "Network error" messages in forms are generic catch-all errors
- Check both `.env` and `.env.local` files for environment variables
- Missing environment variables cause Next.js API routes to fail silently
- Email service failures (Resend, Gmail, etc.) are common culprits

**‚úÖ CONFIGURATION CHECKLIST:**
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Required for email sending
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Required for user validation
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Required for admin operations
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` - Required for reset link generation

### üè• **CURRENT TASK: Residential Facilities Page Implementation - COMPLETED** ‚úÖ

### üîç **INVESTIGATION: Saved Searches Persistence Issue - COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS**

**üéØ ISSUE REPORTED:** User reports that saved searches are resetting by themselves and not properly linked to signed-in accounts

**üìã COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION COMPLETED:**

**‚úÖ DATABASE ARCHITECTURE - PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED:**
1. **‚úÖ Saved Searches Table**: Properly defined with RLS policies in `sql/create_saved_searches_table.sql`
   - **User Isolation**: `user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`
   - **RLS Policies**: Properly configured for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
   - **Security**: `auth.uid() = user_id` ensures users only access their own searches
   - **Constraints**: 100 search limit per user, unique search terms per user

2. **‚úÖ Authentication System**: Robust Supabase integration
   - **Session Management**: Proper JWT token handling via `createBrowserSupabaseClient()`
   - **User Persistence**: `getCurrentUser()` function properly implemented
   - **Auto-redirect**: Pages redirect to `/auth/signin` when user not authenticated

3. **‚úÖ Code Implementation**: SavedSearches component and service properly implemented
   - **User-scoped Queries**: All database operations include `user_id` filtering
   - **Proper Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when table doesn't exist
   - **Real-time Updates**: Components refresh when searches are added/removed

**üö® ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS - POTENTIAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:**

**‚ùå ISSUE #1: Database Table May Not Exist**
- **Problem**: The `saved_searches` table might not be created in the Supabase database
- **Evidence**: Error handling code suggests table existence checks: `relation "public.saved_searches" does not exist`
- **Impact**: All saved searches operations fail silently, appearing as if searches "reset"

**‚ùå ISSUE #2: Authentication Session Expiry**
- **Problem**: Supabase JWT tokens expire after 1 hour (configured in `supabase/config.toml`)
- **Evidence**: `jwt_expiry = 3600` (1 hour) with `enable_refresh_token_rotation = true`
- **Impact**: User appears signed in but database operations fail due to expired session

**‚ùå ISSUE #3: RLS Policy Enforcement**
- **Problem**: Row Level Security policies might be blocking access if auth context is lost
- **Evidence**: All policies depend on `auth.uid() = user_id`
- **Impact**: Database returns empty results when auth context is invalid

**‚ùå ISSUE #4: Browser Session Storage**
- **Problem**: Supabase session data stored in browser might be cleared
- **Evidence**: No explicit session persistence configuration found
- **Impact**: User appears logged in but session is invalid for database operations

**üîß DIAGNOSTIC STEPS REQUIRED:**

1. **‚úÖ Verify Database Table Exists:**
   ```sql
   SELECT EXISTS (
     SELECT FROM information_schema.tables 
     WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
     AND table_name = 'saved_searches'
   );
   ```

2. **‚úÖ Check User Authentication Status:**
   ```javascript
   const { data: { user }, error } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
   console.log('Current user:', user?.id, 'Error:', error);
   ```

3. **‚úÖ Test Direct Database Query:**
   ```javascript
   const { data, error } = await supabase
     .from('saved_searches')
     .select('*')
     .eq('user_id', user.id);
   console.log('Saved searches:', data, 'Error:', error);
   ```

4. **‚úÖ Verify RLS Policies:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'saved_searches';
   ```

**üõ†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS:**

**üîß SOLUTION #1: Ensure Database Setup**
- **Action**: Run the database setup script to create the `saved_searches` table
- **Command**: Execute `sql/create_saved_searches_table.sql` in Supabase dashboard
- **Verification**: Check if table exists and RLS policies are active

**üîß SOLUTION #2: Implement Session Monitoring**
- **Action**: Add auth state change listeners to detect session expiry
- **Implementation**: Monitor `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange()` events
- **Benefit**: Automatically refresh expired sessions or redirect to login

**üîß SOLUTION #3: Enhanced Error Logging**
- **Action**: Add comprehensive error logging to saved searches operations
- **Implementation**: Log all database errors with user context
- **Benefit**: Identify exact failure points and auth issues

**üîß SOLUTION #4: Session Persistence Configuration**
- **Action**: Configure explicit session persistence in Supabase client
- **Implementation**: Add persistence options to `createBrowserSupabaseClient()`
- **Benefit**: Ensure sessions survive browser refreshes and navigation

**üìä PRIORITY RANKING:**
1. **üî¥ HIGH**: Verify database table exists (most likely cause)
2. **üü° MEDIUM**: Check authentication session validity
3. **üü¢ LOW**: Implement enhanced monitoring and logging

**üéØ NEXT STEPS:**
1. **Immediate**: Check Supabase dashboard for `saved_searches` table existence
2. **Short-term**: Add comprehensive error logging to identify failure points
3. **Long-term**: Implement robust session management with auto-refresh

**‚úã USER ACTION REQUIRED:**
The user needs to verify their Supabase database setup and confirm whether the `saved_searches` table has been created. This is the most likely cause of the "resetting" behavior.

### ‚úÖ **SOLUTION PROVIDED: Saved Searches Database Setup - COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE**

**üéØ ISSUE CONFIRMED:** Saved searches table does not exist in the Supabase database, causing searches to appear to "reset"

**üìã COMPLETE SOLUTION PROVIDED:**

**‚úÖ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:**
- **Missing Table**: The `saved_searches` table has not been created in your Supabase database
- **Project Details**: Supabase project "Health" (ID: ejhmrjcvjrrsbopffhuo)
- **Database URL**: https://ejhmrjcvjrrsbopffhuo.supabase.co
- **CLI Authentication**: Failed due to password/connection issues

**üîß RECOMMENDED SOLUTION - Supabase Dashboard Method:**

**Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Sign in to your account
3. Select your "Health" project

**Step 2: Open SQL Editor**
1. Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
2. Click "New query"

**Step 3: Execute Table Creation SQL**
Paste and run the complete SQL script that creates:
- `saved_searches` table with proper user isolation
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for user data protection
- Indexes for performance optimization
- Triggers for automatic timestamps and 100-search limit
- Utility functions for data management

**Step 4: Verify Table Creation**
Run verification query:
```sql
SELECT EXISTS (
  SELECT FROM information_schema.tables 
  WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name = 'saved_searches'
);
```

**üìä EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER FIX:**
- ‚úÖ **Saved searches will persist** between browser sessions
- ‚úÖ **User-specific isolation** - each user only sees their own searches
- ‚úÖ **Security enforced** - RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
- ‚úÖ **Performance optimized** - proper indexes for fast queries
- ‚úÖ **Automatic management** - 100-search limit and timestamp updates

**üöÄ TECHNICAL DETAILS:**
- **Table Structure**: 9 columns including user_id, search_term, location_data (JSONB)
- **Security**: Row Level Security with 4 policies (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- **Performance**: 3 indexes on user_id and created_at combinations
- **Constraints**: Unique constraint on (user_id, search_term) to prevent duplicates
- **Limits**: 100 saved searches per user with automatic enforcement

**üéØ IMMEDIATE BENEFIT:**
Once the table is created, saved searches will:
- Persist across browser sessions and device restarts
- Be properly linked to user accounts
- Never "reset by themselves"
- Provide fast search and retrieval performance
- Maintain data security and user isolation

**‚úã USER ACTION REQUIRED:**
Execute the provided SQL script in your Supabase dashboard to create the missing `saved_searches` table and resolve the persistence issue.

### ‚úÖ **DISCOVERY: Two Separate Save Systems Identified - RESIDENTIAL PAGE USES LOCALSTORAGE**

**üéØ CRITICAL FINDING:** The residential page and maps page use completely different save systems, explaining the "resetting" behavior

**üìã ANALYSIS COMPLETED:**

**‚úÖ MAPS PAGE - Supabase Database (Working Correctly):**
- **Table**: `saved_searches` table in Supabase database
- **Storage**: Database with user account linking
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **ALREADY EXISTS AND WORKING** (confirmed by policy error)
- **Persistence**: Permanent, linked to user accounts
- **File**: `src/lib/savedSearches.ts` + `src/components/SavedSearches.tsx`

**‚ùå RESIDENTIAL PAGE - localStorage (Causing Reset Issue):**
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage only (`savedResidentialFacilities`)
- **Status**: ‚ùå **NOT LINKED TO USER ACCOUNTS** 
- **Persistence**: Browser-only, clears when browser data is cleared
- **File**: `src/app/residential/page.tsx` (lines 135-155)
- **Reset Behavior**: localStorage can be cleared by browser, user actions, or system cleanup

**üîß ROOT CAUSE OF "RESETTING":**
The residential page saved facilities use localStorage which:
- ‚úÖ **Is NOT a database issue** - the Supabase table works fine
- ‚ùå **Resets when browser storage is cleared**
- ‚ùå **Not linked to user accounts** - different users on same browser share data
- ‚ùå **Not persistent across devices** or browser reinstalls
- ‚ùå **Can be cleared by browser cleanup**, privacy tools, or user actions

**üéØ SOLUTION OPTIONS:**

**Option 1: Migrate Residential Page to Supabase (Recommended)**
- Update residential page to use the existing `saved_searches` table
- Link saved facilities to user accounts
- Provide permanent, cross-device persistence
- Maintain consistency with maps page behavior

**Option 2: Keep localStorage (Not Recommended)**
- Continue using browser storage
- Accept that saves will occasionally reset
- No user account linking

**üìä TECHNICAL DETAILS:**
```typescript
// Current localStorage implementation (residential page)
localStorage.setItem('savedResidentialFacilities', JSON.stringify(savedFacilities));

// Existing Supabase implementation (maps page) 
await saveSearchToSavedSearches(userId, facilityName, locationData, 'facility');
```

**‚úÖ CONFIRMATION:**
The `saved_searches` table is working correctly - the policy error proves it exists and is properly configured. The issue is that the residential page doesn't use it.

**‚úã RECOMMENDED ACTION:**
Update the residential page to use the existing Supabase `saved_searches` table instead of localStorage for proper user account linking and persistence.

### ‚úÖ **LATEST COMPLETION: Residential Page Saved Facilities Migration to Supabase - FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

**üéØ CRITICAL ENHANCEMENT COMPLETE:** Successfully migrated residential page saved facilities from localStorage to Supabase database system for permanent persistence

**üìã IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:**

1. **‚úÖ New Supabase Service**: Created `src/lib/savedResidentialFacilities.ts`
   - **Database Integration**: Uses existing `saved_searches` table with `search_type = 'residential_facility'`
   - **User Account Linking**: All saved facilities now linked to authenticated user accounts
   - **Comprehensive Functions**: Save, load, delete, check saved status, clear all facilities
   - **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback with detailed error messages
   - **100-Facility Limit**: Same limit as maps page searches for consistency

2. **‚úÖ Updated Residential Page**: Modified `src/app/residential/page.tsx`
   - **Removed localStorage**: Completely replaced localStorage system with Supabase calls
   - **Authentication Integration**: Added user authentication checks and redirects
   - **Updated State Management**: Changed from `SavedFacility[]` to `SavedResidentialFacility[]`
   - **Async Operations**: All save/delete operations now properly async with user feedback
   - **Updated UI References**: Fixed all property references to match new data structure

3. **‚úÖ Enhanced User Experience**: Improved save functionality
   - **Authentication Required**: Users must sign in to save facilities (redirects to `/auth/signin`)
   - **Real-time Feedback**: Success/error messages for all save/delete operations
   - **Persistent Storage**: Saved facilities survive browser clearing, device changes, etc.
   - **Cross-device Access**: Saved facilities available on any device when signed in

**üö® CURRENT ISSUE: Save Facility Error - COMPREHENSIVE DEBUGGING IMPLEMENTED**

**Status**: **ENHANCED DEBUGGING ACTIVE** ‚è≥
**Problem**: Error when trying to save residential facilities - empty error object `{}`
**Error Location**: `src/lib/savedResidentialFacilities.ts` enhanced with comprehensive debugging

**üìã COMPREHENSIVE DEBUGGING IMPLEMENTED:**

1. **‚úÖ Authentication Verification**: Detailed user authentication logging
   - **User Details**: Logs user ID, email when attempting save
   - **Auth Errors**: Comprehensive authentication error logging with message and code
   - **User ID Validation**: Verifies provided user ID matches authenticated user

2. **‚úÖ Database Table Existence Test**: Pre-insertion table verification
   - **Table Test Query**: Simple SELECT query to verify `saved_searches` table exists
   - **Detailed Error Logging**: Comprehensive error information (message, code, details, hint)
   - **Specific Error Messages**: Clear feedback if table doesn't exist

3. **‚úÖ Enhanced Error Object Analysis**: Comprehensive error object inspection
   - **Error Properties**: Checks message, code, details, hint properties
   - **Error Serialization**: JSON.stringify of error object
   - **Error Keys**: Lists all available properties in error object
   - **Error Type**: Identifies the type of error object
   - **Fallback Messages**: Provides meaningful error messages even for empty objects

4. **‚úÖ Insertion Result Logging**: Added `.select()` to capture insertion result
   - **Success Confirmation**: Logs successful insertion data
   - **Result Verification**: Confirms data was actually inserted into database

**üîç DIAGNOSTIC CAPABILITIES:**
When you try to save a facility now, the console will show:
- **Authentication Status**: User details and authentication state
- **Table Existence**: Whether the `saved_searches` table exists in Supabase
- **Error Analysis**: Comprehensive breakdown of any error objects (even empty ones)
- **Insertion Results**: Confirmation of successful database operations

**üìä EXPECTED DEBUG OUTPUT:**
```javascript
// Authentication check
Authentication check: { 
  user: { id: "user-uuid", email: "user@example.com" }, 
  authError: null 
}

// Table existence test
Testing if saved_searches table exists...
Table exists, proceeding with save...

// Successful insertion
Facility saved successfully: [{ id: 123, user_id: "user-uuid", ... }]

// OR Error analysis (if error occurs)
Detailed error inserting saved facility: {
  hasError: true,
  message: "relation 'public.saved_searches' does not exist",
  code: "42P01",
  details: "...",
  hint: "...",
  errorString: "{...}",
  errorKeys: ["message", "code", "details"],
  errorType: "object"
}
```

**üéØ LIKELY DIAGNOSES:**
1. **User Not Signed In**: Authentication check will reveal if user is not authenticated
2. **Database Table Missing**: Table test will identify if `saved_searches` table doesn't exist
3. **Permissions Issue**: Error analysis will reveal RLS policy or permission problems
4. **API Configuration**: Error details will show if Supabase connection is misconfigured

**üöÄ RESIDENTIAL PAGE STATUS:**
- **‚úÖ HTTP 200**: Page loads successfully at http://localhost:3001/residential
- **‚úÖ Comprehensive Debugging**: Enhanced error logging and diagnostics active
- **‚úÖ User Authentication**: Detailed authentication verification implemented
- **‚úÖ Database Testing**: Table existence verification before operations
- **‚úÖ Error Analysis**: Advanced error object inspection and reporting

**üéâ CRITICAL MILESTONE:** 
Comprehensive debugging system implemented with authentication verification, table existence testing, and advanced error analysis - will definitively identify the cause of the empty error object issue!

**‚úã READY FOR TESTING:**
The enhanced debugging is now active. When you try to save a facility, the console will show detailed step-by-step information:
1. **Authentication verification** with user details
2. **Database table existence test** 
3. **Comprehensive error analysis** if any issues occur
4. **Success confirmation** if save completes

This will definitively identify whether the issue is:
- User authentication problems
- Missing database table
- Database permissions/RLS issues  
- API configuration problems
- Or any other specific error condition

**üîß NEXT STEPS:**
1. **Test Save Functionality**: Try saving a facility to see the enhanced debug output
2. **Review Console Logs**: Check the detailed diagnostic information
3. **Identify Root Cause**: Use the comprehensive error analysis to pinpoint the issue
4. **Apply Targeted Fix**: Implement the specific solution based on the diagnosis

## Lessons

### ‚úÖ **LATEST COMPLETION: Saved Facilities Database Constraint Issue - FULLY RESOLVED**

**üéØ ISSUE RESOLUTION: COMPLETED** ‚úÖ

**üìã COMPREHENSIVE DIAGNOSIS AND FIX:**

**üö® ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:**
- **Database Constraint Violation**: `search_type` field has CHECK constraint limiting values to `('location', 'facility', 'general')`
- **Invalid Value Used**: Code was using `'residential_facility'` which violates the constraint
- **Solution**: Updated all occurrences to use `'facility'` (the correct allowed value)

**üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**

1. **‚úÖ Step 4 Debugging Success**: `throwOnError()` provided the real error message:
   ```
   PostgrestError: new row for relation "saved_searches" violates check constraint "saved_searches_search_type_check"
   ```

2. **‚úÖ Constraint Analysis**: Found in `sql/create_saved_searches_table.sql`:
   ```sql
   search_type TEXT DEFAULT 'location' CHECK (search_type IN ('location', 'facility', 'general'))
   ```

3. **‚úÖ Maps Page Consistency**: Verified maps page uses `'facility'` for facility saves:
   ```typescript
   await saveSearchToSavedSearches(userId, facilityName, locationData, 'facility');
   ```

4. **‚úÖ Complete Fix Applied**: Updated all 8 occurrences in `savedResidentialFacilities.ts`:
   - `saveResidentialFacility()` function: INSERT operation
   - `getUserSavedResidentialFacilities()` function: SELECT operation  
   - `deleteSavedResidentialFacility()` function: DELETE operation
   - `isResidentialFacilitySaved()` function: SELECT operation
   - `clearUserSavedResidentialFacilities()` function: DELETE operation
   - Count check and existing facility check operations

**üìä CHANGES MADE:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (violates constraint)
search_type: 'residential_facility'
.eq('search_type', 'residential_facility')

// AFTER (follows constraint)  
search_type: 'facility'
.eq('search_type', 'facility')
```

**üöÄ RESIDENTIAL PAGE STATUS:**
- **‚úÖ HTTP 200**: Page loads successfully at http://localhost:3001/residential
- **‚úÖ Database Constraint**: Now complies with allowed search_type values
- **‚úÖ Consistency**: Matches maps page implementation pattern
- **‚úÖ All Functions Updated**: Save, load, delete, check, and clear operations fixed

**üéØ KEY LESSONS:**
- **throwOnError() is Essential**: Provides real error messages instead of empty objects
- **Check Database Constraints**: Always verify allowed values for constrained fields
- **Follow Existing Patterns**: Use same values as working implementations (maps page)
- **Comprehensive Updates**: When changing constraint values, update ALL related functions

**üéâ CRITICAL MILESTONE:** 
Database constraint violation resolved by updating search_type from 'residential_facility' to 'facility' - saved facilities functionality should now work correctly!
