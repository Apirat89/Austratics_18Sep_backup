2. **Dependency Array Cleanup**: Removed `config` object from ScatterPlotConfig useEffect dependencies
3. **State Initialization Guard**: Added `isInitialized` ref to prevent repeated state updates
4. **Data Loading Guards**: Enhanced data loading with refs to prevent race conditions

**🔍 CURRENT STATUS:**
- **✅ Page Loading**: http://localhost:3000/newdashboard loads successfully (200 responses)
- **✅ Initial Render**: Shows loading state "Loading dashboard data..." and "Initializing..."
- **✅ Server Compilation**: No build errors, TypeScript compilation successful
- **❓ Loop Timing**: Need clarification on when infinite loop occurs

**🤔 INVESTIGATION NEEDED:**
**Question for User:** When exactly does the infinite loop error appear?
1. **Immediately on page load** (during loading screen)?
2. **After data loads** (when Add Widget button appears)?
3. **When clicking Add Widget** (opening chart type modal)?
4. **During chart configuration** (variable selection dropdowns)?
5. **When creating scatter plot** (chart rendering)?

**🔄 NEXT DEBUGGING STEPS:**
Based on user's clarification, we can:
- Add console logging to specific component lifecycle events
- Temporarily disable specific components to isolate the issue
- Test individual widget creation steps
- Check for other components causing re-render loops
