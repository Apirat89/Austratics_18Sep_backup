## ✅ **FACILITY LOADING SPINNER REMOVED - COMPLETED**

**EXECUTOR MODE ACTIVE** ⚙️

**USER REQUEST:** Remove facility loading spinner as there's already a preloading status at bottom right of map

**✅ COMPLETED REMOVALS:**
- ❌ Removed `FacilityLoadingSpinner` component import from maps page
- ❌ Removed `facilitySpinnerVisible` state variable
- ❌ Removed `handleFacilityLoadingChange` callback function  
- ❌ Removed `onFacilityLoadingChange` prop from AustralianMap usage
- ❌ Removed `onFacilityLoadingChange` prop from AustralianMap interface
- ❌ Removed callback usages in AustralianMap component (`onFacilityLoadingChange?.(true/false)`)
- ❌ Deleted `src/components/FacilityLoadingSpinner.tsx` file entirely

**🎯 RESULT:**
- **No facility loading spinner** shown during facility updates
- **Existing bottom-right preloading status** remains as primary loading indicator
- **Clean codebase** with no redundant loading components
- **All linter errors resolved**
- **Build successful** - No compilation errors related to removed spinner code
- **Application running** - Development server starts without issues

## ✅ **WEBPACK RUNTIME ERROR FIXED - COMPLETED**

**EXECUTOR MODE ACTIVE** ⚙️

**USER ISSUE:** Runtime Error - "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')" in webpack runtime and _not-found page

**✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:**
- **Missing `not-found.tsx` file** - Next.js 13+ app router requires this file for 404 handling
- **Webpack trying to generate `_not-found/page.js`** but source file didn't exist
- **Server-side rendering failure** during page generation

**✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:**
- **Created `src/app/not-found.tsx`** with proper 404 page component
- **Added Next.js Link navigation** back to home page
- **Styled with Tailwind** for consistent UI
- **Follows Next.js app router conventions** for error pages

**🎯 RESULT:**
- **Webpack runtime error resolved** - No more undefined 'call' errors
- **Development server running** - Process 81858 active without issues  
- **404 page functional** - Proper error handling for missing routes
- **Clean error handling** - Users see friendly 404 instead of runtime crashes

## ✅ **GITHUB PUSH TO BOTH BRANCHES - COMPLETED**

**EXECUTOR MODE ACTIVE** ⚙️

**USER REQUEST:** Push this version to both branches of GitHub

## 🚨 **MAPS FACILITY TOGGLE PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION**

**USER REQUEST:** 
1. ✅ No spinner on map load now (working!)
2. Make spinner last 6 seconds when facility selection is toggled  
3. Move spinner to left sidebar panel next to facility selection (not over map)
4. Remove test/toggle buttons from map

**PLANNER MODE ACTIVE** 🧠

## Background and Motivation

The facility spinner integration is now working correctly:
- ✅ **No interference with initial page load** - spinner prevention working
- ✅ **Checkbox integration functional** - debug logs show proper state flow
- ✅ **Manual test controls work** - spinner UI is functional

**Current Issues to Address:**
1. **Duration too short**: 2-second minimum feels rushed for 6-second loading operations
2. **Poor UX placement**: Spinner over map center is intrusive and conflicts with map interactions
3. **Development artifacts**: Test buttons should be removed for production

**Target UX:**
1. **6-second spinner duration** - matches actual facility loading time
2. **Sidebar placement** - non-intrusive, contextually relevant to facility controls
3. **Clean production UI** - no debug/test buttons

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### **Challenge 1: Spinner Duration Update**
**Current State**: 2-second minimum duration with setTimeout
**Target**: 6-second duration for better user feedback
**Solution**: Simple timeout value change from 2000ms to 6000ms
**Risk Level**: ⭐ LOW - straightforward change

### **Challenge 2: Sidebar Integration**
**Current State**: FacilityLoadingSpinner renders as map overlay with backdrop
**Target**: Inline spinner in left sidebar next to "Facility Selection" section
**Implementation**: 
- Move spinner component to sidebar JSX location
- Update styling from overlay/backdrop to inline sidebar component
- Position next to facility selection controls
**Risk Level**: ⭐⭐ MEDIUM - requires layout and styling changes

### **Challenge 3: Styling Adaptation**
**Current State**: Spinner designed for center-map overlay with backdrop
**Target**: Compact sidebar inline component
**Requirements**:
- Remove backdrop/overlay styling
- Compact design suitable for sidebar
- Maintain visibility without dominating UI
- Match sidebar aesthetic
**Risk Level**: ⭐⭐ MEDIUM - needs careful UI design

### **Challenge 4: Clean Production UI**
**Current State**: Debug test buttons visible on map
**Target**: Remove all debug/test controls
**Solution**: Remove manual test button JSX elements
**Risk Level**: ⭐ LOW - simple removal

## High-level Task Breakdown

### **Phase 1: Update Spinner Duration** ⏱️
**Goal**: Change spinner minimum display from 2 seconds to 6 seconds
**Tasks**:
1.1 Update `handleFacilityLoadingChange` timeout from 2000ms to 6000ms
1.2 Test duration with manual controls before moving to sidebar

### **Phase 2: Design Sidebar Spinner Component** 🎨
**Goal**: Create compact inline spinner suitable for sidebar placement
**Tasks**:
2.1 Update `FacilityLoadingSpinner` component styling
2.2 Remove overlay/backdrop styling (absolute positioning, backdrop)
2.3 Add compact inline design (smaller spinner, minimal text)
2.4 Ensure sidebar aesthetic compatibility

### **Phase 3: Relocate Spinner to Sidebar** 📍
**Goal**: Move spinner from map overlay to sidebar facility section
**Tasks**:
3.1 Find facility selection section in sidebar JSX
3.2 Move `<FacilityLoadingSpinner>` component to sidebar location
3.3 Position next to "Facility Selection" heading/controls
3.4 Remove map overlay rendering location

### **Phase 4: Remove Debug Controls** 🧹
**Goal**: Clean up production UI by removing test buttons
**Tasks**:
4.1 Remove "Test 3s" and "Toggle" button JSX elements
4.2 Clean up associated click handlers (optional - can leave for future debug)
4.3 Verify clean production appearance

## Project Status Board

- **CRITICAL: Fix Runtime Error** ✅ COMPLETE (error resolved by restart)
- **Phase 1: Update Duration** ✅ COMPLETE (2000ms → 6000ms)
- **Phase 2: Design Sidebar Spinner** ✅ COMPLETE (compact inline design)
- **Phase 3: Relocate to Sidebar** ✅ COMPLETE (moved next to "Facility Selection")
- **Phase 4: Remove Debug Controls** ✅ COMPLETE (test buttons removed)

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

*No current blockers - implementation plan is clear and straightforward*

## Lessons

- **Spinner placement matters**: Map overlay is intrusive, sidebar is contextually better
- **Duration should match actual loading time**: 2s feels rushed, 6s matches reality
- **Debug artifacts need cleanup**: Test buttons fine for development, remove for production
- **Initial load prevention working well**: No reports of initial page load spinner conflicts

**READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION** - All requirements are clear and technically feasible 🚀
