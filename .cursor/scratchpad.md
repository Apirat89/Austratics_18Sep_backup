### ✅ **LATEST COMPLETION: Simplified Dashboard Implementation**

**🎯 NEW FEATURE STATUS: BASIC DASHBOARD WORKING - Data Loading Issue**

**📋 WHAT WAS COMPLETED:**
- ✅ **Dashboard Page Created**: New `/dashboard` route with simplified implementation
- ✅ **Data Service Integration**: Uses existing InsightsDataService for data loading
- ✅ **5 Chart Types**: Healthcare overview, demographics, economics, health stats, spending mix
- ✅ **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators and error handling
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Grid layout with individual chart containers
- ✅ **Data Summary Panel**: Shows record counts for each data type

**⚠️ CURRENT ISSUE: Only Population Pyramid Appearing**
- **User Report**: Only Chart D (Population Pyramid) is rendering
- **Likely Cause**: Data filtering issues - other charts not getting valid data
- **Charts A-C and E**: Not rendering due to missing required fields
- **Data Access**: Using reflection to access private data service properties

**🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**
- **File**: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Simplified working dashboard
- **Data Loading**: Uses `InsightsDataService.loadAllData()` method
- **Chart Rendering**: 5 distinct ECharts implementations with data validation
- **Error Handling**: Individual chart error boundaries and loading states

**📊 CHART TYPES IMPLEMENTED:**
1. **Chart A**: Healthcare Overview - Bar chart of top 20 regions by CHSP participants
2. **Chart B**: Demographics - Bar chart of top 15 regions by population
3. **Chart C**: Economics - Scatter plot of income vs employment rate
4. **Chart D**: Health Stats - Pie chart of average health condition prevalence ✅ WORKING
5. **Chart E**: Healthcare Spending - Pie chart of total spending by program

**🚨 DEBUG STATUS:**
- **Loading Working**: Dashboard loads and shows loading states properly
- **Data Service**: InsightsDataService.loadAllData() completes successfully
- **Chart D Only**: Only the health stats pie chart appears, others don't render
- **Missing Fields**: Likely issue with derived fields or data transformation
- **Data Validation**: Each chart has filtering logic that may reject invalid data

**🔄 NEXT STEPS NEEDED:**
1. **Debug Data Structure**: Check what fields are actually available in loaded data
2. **Chart Validation**: Verify filtering logic matches available data fields
3. **Console Logging**: Add debug logging to see why charts A, B, C, E return null
4. **Data Inspection**: Examine sample records to understand field naming/structure

**📍 ACCESS:**
- **Dashboard URL**: http://localhost:3000/dashboard
- **Status**: Loading works, but only 1 of 5 charts renders
- **Expected**: All 5 charts should display with healthcare/demographics/economics data

**🎯 PRIORITY:** Fix data availability issue so all 5 charts render properly with the existing data sources.
