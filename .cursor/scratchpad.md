# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

This is an Aged Care Analytics platform project that was previously managed using Task Master. All tasks have been transferred from the Task Master system to this scratchpad for continued management.

The project is a Next.js application focused on healthcare analytics for the aged care industry in Australia, featuring:
- Interactive data visualizations (deck.gl, ECharts)
- AI-powered chat system with Gemini integration
- Geographic analytics with real aged care facility data
- Advanced security infrastructure
- Multi-tenant enterprise features

## Key Challenges and Analysis

**Critical Production Blockers:**
- Domain registration and email configuration needed for production launch
- Seven-layer security infrastructure gaps must be addressed
- Email allowlist validation system needed for controlled signup access

**Technical Architecture Challenges:**
- Integration of multiple visualization engines (deck.gl for geographic, ECharts for business charts)
- AI chat system requiring healthcare-specific safety filters and HIPAA compliance
- Complex data integration from multiple Australian government datasets
- Performance optimization for large healthcare datasets

**Priority Dependencies:**
- Domain/email setup blocks production launch but can be done in parallel
- Visualization engines are foundational for analytics functionality
- Security infrastructure is critical before any production deployment

**CRITICAL DATA ARCHITECTURE LESSONS:**
- ⚠️ **NEVER USE FUZZY MATCHING FOR FIELD NAMES** - Causes data mapping bugs where different fields map to same values
- ✅ **USE EXACT MATCHING ONLY** - API data format should be consistent (pipe separators: "Category | Subcategory")
- ✅ **MINIMAL FORMAT CONVERSION** - Only basic pipe ↔ underscore conversion if absolutely needed
- 🚫 **AVOID COMPLEX STRING SIMILARITY** - Levenshtein distance, fuzzy matching creates more problems than it solves
- 📝 **ROOT CAUSE OVER BAND-AIDS** - Fix data inconsistencies at the source, not with complex matching logic
