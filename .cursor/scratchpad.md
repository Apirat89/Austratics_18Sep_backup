# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

This is an Aged Care Analytics platform project that was previously managed using Task Master. All tasks have been transferred from the Task Master system to this scratchpad for continued management.

The project is a Next.js application focused on healthcare analytics for the aged care industry in Australia, featuring:
- Interactive data visualizations (deck.gl, ECharts)
- AI-powered chat system with Gemini integration
- Geographic analytics with real aged care facility data
- Advanced security infrastructure
- Multi-tenant enterprise features

## Key Challenges and Analysis

**Critical Production Blockers:**
- Domain registration and email configuration needed for production launch
- Seven-layer security infrastructure gaps must be addressed
- Email allowlist validation system needed for controlled signup access

**Technical Architecture Challenges:**
- Integration of multiple visualization engines (deck.gl for geographic, ECharts for business charts)
- AI chat system requiring healthcare-specific safety filters and HIPAA compliance
- Complex data integration from multiple Australian government datasets
- Performance optimization for large healthcare datasets

**Priority Dependencies:**
- Domain/email setup blocks production launch but can be done in parallel
- Visualization engines are foundational for analytics functionality
- Security infrastructure is critical before any production deployment

**Next Steps Recommended:**
1. Test the maps2 heatmap functionality at http://localhost:3000/maps2 - should now show prominent neon blue shading
2. Select a data category from dropdown to activate heatmap visualization
3. Begin work on critical production blockers (Task 1: Domain Registration or Task 11: Security Infrastructure)  
4. Decide priority between domain setup vs security implementation

**Questions for Planning:**
- Should we prioritize domain registration (Task 1) or security infrastructure (Task 11) first?
- Are there any additional tasks or requirements not captured in the transfer?

## Lessons

### Task Transfer Process
- âœ… Successfully extracted 11 main tasks + 1 specific signup task from Task Master
- âœ… Maintained all task details, priorities, dependencies, and test strategies
- âœ… Organized tasks by priority levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- âœ… Preserved all implementation details and acceptance criteria
- âœ… Completely removed Task Master system (.taskmaster/, tasks/, TASK_MASTER_SETUP.md)
- âœ… Cleaned up MCP server configuration to remove Task Master integration
- âœ… Successfully migrated to scratchpad-based project management

### Project Structure Understanding
- The project uses Next.js with TypeScript
- Heavy focus on data visualization and healthcare analytics
- Multiple AI/ML integration points (Gemini, predictive analytics)
- Strong emphasis on security and compliance (HIPAA)
- Australian market focus with government dataset integration

### Priority Insights
- Production launch is blocked by domain/email setup and security infrastructure
- Visualization engines are foundational and can be developed in parallel
- Data integration and processing is critical for all analytics features
- Enterprise features (multi-tenancy, advanced ML) are lower priority
