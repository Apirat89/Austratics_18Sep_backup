# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

This is an Aged Care Analytics platform project that was previously managed using Task Master. All tasks have been transferred from the Task Master system to this scratchpad for continued management.

The project is a Next.js application focused on healthcare analytics for the aged care industry in Australia, featuring:
- Interactive data visualizations (deck.gl, ECharts)
- AI-powered chat system with Gemini integration
- Geographic analytics with real aged care facility data
- Advanced security infrastructure
- Multi-tenant enterprise features

## Key Challenges and Analysis

**Critical Production Blockers:**
- Domain registration and email configuration needed for production launch
- Seven-layer security infrastructure gaps must be addressed
- Email allowlist validation system needed for controlled signup access

**Technical Architecture Challenges:**
- Integration of multiple visualization engines (deck.gl for geographic, ECharts for business charts)
- AI chat system requiring healthcare-specific safety filters and HIPAA compliance
- Complex data integration from multiple Australian government datasets
- Performance optimization for large healthcare datasets

**Priority Dependencies:**
- Domain/email setup blocks production launch but can be done in parallel
- Visualization engines are foundational for analytics functionality
- Security infrastructure is critical before any production deployment

**CRITICAL DATA ARCHITECTURE LESSONS:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER USE FUZZY MATCHING FOR FIELD NAMES** - Causes data mapping bugs where different fields map to same values
- ‚úÖ **USE EXACT MATCHING ONLY** - API data format should be consistent (pipe separators: "Category | Subcategory")
- ‚úÖ **MINIMAL FORMAT CONVERSION** - Only basic pipe ‚Üî underscore conversion if absolutely needed
- üö´ **AVOID COMPLEX STRING SIMILARITY** - Levenshtein distance, fuzzy matching creates more problems than it solves
- üìù **ROOT CAUSE OVER BAND-AIDS** - Fix data inconsistencies at the source, not with complex matching logic

   # Email Service (REQUIRED for password reset)
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Get Resend API Key:**
   - Go to https://resend.com/
   - Create free account
   - Generate API key from dashboard
   - Replace `re_YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE` with real key

3. **Restart Development Server:**
   ```bash
   # Kill existing servers and restart
   npm run dev
   ```

**üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED:**
User needs to add the missing environment variables to fix the password reset functionality.

**‚úÖ VERIFICATION STEPS:**
1. Add environment variables to `.env.local`
2. Restart development server
3. Test password reset page at `/auth/forgot-password`
4. Should no longer show "Network error"

## Lessons

### üìö **Password Reset Network Error Diagnosis**

**üîç INVESTIGATION PROCESS:**
- **Always check environment variables first** - Many "network errors" are actually missing API keys
- **Review server logs** - Frontend "network error" often hides backend exceptions
- **Test API routes directly** - Use browser dev tools or curl to isolate frontend vs backend issues
- **Check email service configuration** - Email sending failures commonly cause password reset errors

**‚ö†Ô∏è DEBUGGING TIPS:**
- "Network error" messages in forms are generic catch-all errors
- Check both `.env` and `.env.local` files for environment variables
- Missing environment variables cause Next.js API routes to fail silently
- Email service failures (Resend, Gmail, etc.) are common culprits

**‚úÖ CONFIGURATION CHECKLIST:**
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Required for email sending
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Required for user validation
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Required for admin operations
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` - Required for reset link generation

### ‚úÖ **LATEST COMPLETION: Final Inline Box Plot Fixes - FULLY RESOLVED**

**üéØ IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: COMPLETED** ‚úÖ

**üìã FINAL FIXES APPLIED:**

1. **‚úÖ Residents' Experience Rating Box Plot**: Added missing field name parameter
   - **Fixed**: `renderField("Residents' Experience Rating", selectedFacility["star_Residents' Experience rating"], "star_Residents' Experience rating")`
   - **Result**: Now shows box plot comparison for the overall residents' experience rating

2. **‚úÖ Cost per Day Box Plot in Rooms Tab**: Fixed field mapping issue

   - **Solution**: Mapped to `income_residents_contribution` field which represents what residents pay
   - **Result**: Room cost per day now shows proper box plot comparisons

**üîß TECHNICAL RESOLUTION:**

**Field Mapping Issue:**
- **Original**: `cost_per_day` (not available in statistics)
- **Updated**: `income_residents_contribution` (available and semantically appropriate)
- **Rationale**: Residents' contribution represents the cost residents pay, making it the most appropriate comparison for room costs

**Statistics File Analysis:**
- **Available Cost Fields**: `food_cost_per_day`, `income_residents_contribution`, `income_total_per_day`, `budget_surplus_per_day`
- **Selected Field**: `income_residents_contribution` - most relevant for room cost comparison
- **Coverage**: Statistics available for nationwide, state, postcode, and locality comparisons
