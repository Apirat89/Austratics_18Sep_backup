# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

This is an Aged Care Analytics platform project that was previously managed using Task Master. All tasks have been transferred from the Task Master system to this scratchpad for continued management.

The project is a Next.js application focused on healthcare analytics for the aged care industry in Australia, featuring:
- Interactive data visualizations (deck.gl, ECharts)
- AI-powered chat system with Gemini integration
- Geographic analytics with real aged care facility data
- Advanced security infrastructure
- Multi-tenant enterprise features

## Key Challenges and Analysis

**Critical Production Blockers:**
- Domain registration and email configuration needed for production launch
- Seven-layer security infrastructure gaps must be addressed
- Email allowlist validation system needed for controlled signup access

**Technical Architecture Challenges:**
- Integration of multiple visualization engines (deck.gl for geographic, ECharts for business charts)
- AI chat system requiring healthcare-specific safety filters and HIPAA compliance
- Complex data integration from multiple Australian government datasets
- Performance optimization for large healthcare datasets

**Priority Dependencies:**
- Domain/email setup blocks production launch but can be done in parallel
- Visualization engines are foundational for analytics functionality
- Security infrastructure is critical before any production deployment

**CRITICAL DATA ARCHITECTURE LESSONS:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER USE FUZZY MATCHING FOR FIELD NAMES** - Causes data mapping bugs where different fields map to same values
- ‚úÖ **USE EXACT MATCHING ONLY** - API data format should be consistent (pipe separators: "Category | Subcategory")
- ‚úÖ **MINIMAL FORMAT CONVERSION** - Only basic pipe ‚Üî underscore conversion if absolutely needed
- üö´ **AVOID COMPLEX STRING SIMILARITY** - Levenshtein distance, fuzzy matching creates more problems than it solves
- üìù **ROOT CAUSE OVER BAND-AIDS** - Fix data inconsistencies at the source, not with complex matching logic

**Status:** **SOLVED** ‚úÖ  
**Issue:** User reports "Network error. Please try again." on password reset page
**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/auth/forgot-password`

**üìã ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:**
- ‚ùå **Missing RESEND_API_KEY**: Environment variable not set for email service
- ‚ùå **Missing NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL**: Required for reset link generation
- ‚úÖ **Frontend Code**: Password reset form working correctly
- ‚úÖ **API Route**: Backend logic functional but failing due to missing config
- ‚úÖ **Supabase Config**: All Supabase variables are properly configured

**üîç DETAILED ERROR ANALYSIS:**
```bash
curl test revealed: "Missing API key. Pass it to the constructor `new Resend(\"re_123\")`"
```

**üö® EXACT ISSUE:**
The Resend email service constructor in `/lib/email.ts` is failing because `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable is missing from `.env.local`

**üìù SOLUTION REQUIRED:**
1. **Add Missing Environment Variables to `.env.local`:**
   ```bash
   # Email Service (REQUIRED for password reset)
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Get Resend API Key:**
   - Go to https://resend.com/
   - Create free account
   - Generate API key from dashboard
   - Replace `re_YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE` with real key

3. **Restart Development Server:**
   ```bash
   # Kill existing servers and restart
   npm run dev
   ```

**üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED:**
User needs to add the missing environment variables to fix the password reset functionality.

**‚úÖ VERIFICATION STEPS:**
1. Add environment variables to `.env.local`
2. Restart development server
3. Test password reset page at `/auth/forgot-password`
4. Should no longer show "Network error"

## Lessons

### üö® **CRITICAL GITHUB RULE - NEVER PUSH WITHOUT EXPLICIT REQUEST** üö®

**‚ö†Ô∏è EXTREMELY IMPORTANT RULE:**
- **NEVER push to GitHub without EXPLICIT user request to push**
- **ALWAYS wait for user to specifically ask "push to github" or similar**
- **This prevents accidentally wiping out good versions with failed versions**
- **User must explicitly request: "pls push to github" or "commit and push changes"**
- **Do NOT push automatically after completing tasks or fixes**
- **Do NOT assume user wants changes pushed**

**‚úÖ ONLY push when user explicitly says:**
- "push to github"
- "commit and push"
- "upload to github" 
- "save to repository"
- Or similar explicit GitHub push requests

**üö´ NEVER push when user says:**
- "fix this bug"
- "implement this feature"
- "make this change"
- "update the code"
- Or any other general development request

**üéØ REASON:** Prevents accidental overwrites of working versions with potentially broken code

### üìö **Password Reset Network Error Diagnosis**

**üîç INVESTIGATION PROCESS:**
- **Always check environment variables first** - Many "network errors" are actually missing API keys
- **Review server logs** - Frontend "network error" often hides backend exceptions
- **Test API routes directly** - Use browser dev tools or curl to isolate frontend vs backend issues
- **Check email service configuration** - Email sending failures commonly cause password reset errors

**‚ö†Ô∏è DEBUGGING TIPS:**
- "Network error" messages in forms are generic catch-all errors
- Check both `.env` and `.env.local` files for environment variables
- Missing environment variables cause Next.js API routes to fail silently
- Email service failures (Resend, Gmail, etc.) are common culprits

**‚úÖ CONFIGURATION CHECKLIST:**
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Required for email sending
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Required for user validation
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Required for admin operations
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` - Required for reset link generation

### ‚úÖ **LATEST COMPLETION: Residents' Experience Zero Value Display Fix - FULLY RESOLVED**

**üéØ ENHANCEMENT COMPLETE:** Successfully updated the Residents' Experience section to display all variables including those with 0% values, as requested by the user

**üìã IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:**

1. **‚úÖ New Validation Function**: Created `hasValidValueForExperience()` function
   - **Purpose**: Allows zero values to be displayed in resident experience sections
   - **Logic**: `value !== null && value !== undefined && typeof value === 'number'`
   - **Difference**: Unlike `hasValidValue()`, this includes 0 values

2. **‚úÖ Updated Survey Question Logic**: Modified `renderSurveyQuestion()` function
   - **Question Display**: Now uses `hasValidValueForExperience()` to determine if entire question should show

   - **Box Plot Integration**: Maintains existing box plot functionality for all values including 0%

3. **‚úÖ Preserved Other Sections**: Kept original `hasValidValue()` function for other tabs
   - **Quality Measures**: Still hides fields with 0 values (appropriate for quality metrics)
   - **Financial Data**: Still hides fields with 0 values (appropriate for financial metrics)
   - **Other Tabs**: Maintain existing behavior where 0 values are hidden

**üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**

**Key Changes:**
- **New Function**: `hasValidValueForExperience(value)` - includes zero values
- **Survey Questions**: Now show complete response breakdown including 0% categories
- **Individual Categories**: All four response types (Always, Most of the Time, Some of the Time, Never) display even at 0%
