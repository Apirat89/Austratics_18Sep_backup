# Task ID: 1
# Title: Domain Registration & Email Setup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: critical
# Description: Register Australian domain and configure email service for production launch.
# Details:
CRITICAL PRODUCTION BLOCKER:

- Register agedcareanalytics.com.au domain
- Set up DNS hosting and records
- Get Resend API key and configure email service
- Update email templates to use custom domain
- Configure SPF, DKIM, DMARC records
- Test password reset email functionality

This blocks production launch but can be done in parallel with development work.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify domain ownership and DNS propagation
2. Test email delivery from custom domain
3. Verify password reset flow works end-to-end
4. Check emails land in inbox (not spam)
5. Test across different email providers
