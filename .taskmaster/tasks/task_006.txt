# Task ID: 6
# Title: Healthcare Data Integration & Processing Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build robust data integration system for aged care metrics, government datasets, and real-time analytics processing.
# Details:
BUILD DATA INFRASTRUCTURE:

- Integrate Australian Government aged care datasets (My Aged Care, ACECQA)
- Create data ingestion pipeline for CSV, JSON, API sources
- Build data validation and cleaning processes
- Implement real-time data synchronization
- Create data transformation for visualization formats
- Build caching layer (Redis) for performance
- Implement data quality monitoring and alerts
- Add data lineage tracking and audit logs
- Create backup and recovery systems

This provides the data foundation for all analytics features.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test data ingestion from multiple sources
2. Verify data validation and error handling
3. Test real-time synchronization performance
4. Validate data transformation accuracy
5. Test caching effectiveness and cache invalidation
6. Verify backup and recovery procedures
