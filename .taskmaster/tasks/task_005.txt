# Task ID: 5
# Title: Advanced Geographic Analytics with MapTiler
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance mapping capabilities with real aged care data, demographics overlays, and advanced geographic analytics.
# Details:
BUILD COMPREHENSIVE MAPPING PLATFORM:

- Integrate real aged care facility data (Australian Government datasets)
- Create demographic overlays and population analysis
- Build healthcare services mapping and accessibility analysis
- Implement population density heatmaps and choropleth maps
- Add facility quality ratings and compliance indicators
- Create catchment area analysis and service gaps identification
- Build location-based search and filtering
- Add geographic export capabilities
- Implement mobile-optimized map interactions

This provides the geographic intelligence layer for aged care analytics.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify accuracy of facility location data
2. Test demographic overlay rendering performance
3. Validate population density calculations
4. Test mobile map interactions and responsiveness
5. Verify export functionality for map data
6. Test search and filtering performance
