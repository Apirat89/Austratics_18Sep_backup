# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Seven-Layer Security Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: critical
# Description: Implement critical security infrastructure gaps including security headers, edge protection, API rate limiting, production token storage, and database security to achieve a comprehensive seven-layer security implementation.
# Details:
IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:

1. Security Headers (next.config.ts):
   - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
   - Add HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers
   - Configure X-Frame-Options headers
   - Set up X-XSS-Protection and X-Content-Type-Options headers

2. Edge Protection (vercel.json):
   - Configure rate limiting rules
   - Set up firewall rules to block malicious traffic
   - Implement DDoS protection measures

3. API Blocked Route:
   - Create a new API route for handling rate limit errors
   - Implement custom error responses for rate-limited requests

4. Production Token Storage:
   - Set up a Redis instance using Upstash
   - Refactor token storage from memory Map to Redis
   - Implement connection pooling and error handling for Redis

5. Supabase RLS Verification:
   - Create a database migration for profiles table
   - Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies for profiles
   - Set up audit logging table with appropriate RLS policies
   - Test and verify RLS policies are working as expected

6. Environment Variables:
   - Set up Sentry DSN for error tracking
   - Configure Redis connection string
   - Implement proper environment variable handling for different environments

7. MapTiler API Key Restrictions:
   - Set up origin restrictions for MapTiler API key
   - Implement fallback mechanism for API key issues

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Ensure all security measures are thoroughly tested in a staging environment before deployment
- Document all security implementations for future reference and audits
- Set up regular security scans and penetration testing processes
- Implement a security incident response plan
- Consider implementing Web Application Firewall (WAF) for additional protection

# Test Strategy:
1. Security Headers Testing:
   - Use online security header checkers (e.g., securityheaders.com)
   - Manually verify headers using browser developer tools
   - Test CSP by attempting to inject scripts from unauthorized sources

2. Edge Protection Verification:
   - Use tools like Apache Bench or Siege to simulate high traffic and verify rate limiting
   - Attempt to access the application from known malicious IP ranges
   - Simulate DDoS attacks and verify protection measures

3. API Rate Limiting:
   - Write automated tests to verify rate limit functionality
   - Manually test API endpoints with rapid successive calls
   - Verify custom error responses for rate-limited requests

4. Redis Token Storage:
   - Write unit tests for Redis token storage functions
   - Perform load testing to ensure Redis can handle expected traffic
   - Simulate Redis connection failures and verify error handling

5. Supabase RLS Testing:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for RLS policies
   - Attempt to access data as different user roles to verify proper restrictions
   - Verify audit logging captures all relevant actions

6. Environment Variable Configuration:
   - Verify all necessary environment variables are set in production
   - Test application behavior with missing or incorrect environment variables
   - Ensure sensitive variables are properly encrypted in CI/CD pipelines

7. MapTiler API Restrictions:
   - Attempt to use the MapTiler API from unauthorized origins
   - Verify proper functionality from authorized origins
   - Test fallback mechanism for API key issues

8. Overall Security Assessment:
   - Conduct a full penetration test of the application
   - Use automated security scanning tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Nessus)
   - Perform a manual code review focusing on security-critical areas
   - Verify that the security rating has improved to the target 5/5
