# Priority: high
# Description: Comprehensive security validation of the authentication system including signup, signin, and password reset flows.
# Details:
Complete security audit of authentication system:

- Test complete signup → signin → dashboard flow

- Test SQL injection and XSS prevention

# Test Strategy:
Comprehensive security testing:
1. Test complete user journey from signup to dashboard
2. Attempt to bypass password strength requirements
3. Test with disposable email services
4. Verify rate limiting with automated attempts
5. Test token manipulation and replay attacks
6. Verify session timeout and forced logout
7. Penetration testing for common vulnerabilities
