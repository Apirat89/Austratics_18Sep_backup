# Task ID: 7
# Title: Code Quality & Testing Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive testing suite and code quality tools for maintainable production code.
# Details:
Establish testing and quality infrastructure:

- Add unit tests for authentication functions
- Implement integration tests for API routes
- Set up code coverage reporting
- Add TypeScript strict mode
- Set up error monitoring (Sentry)
- Configure automated testing in CI/CD
- Set up code quality checks (ESLint, Prettier)

# Test Strategy:
Validate testing infrastructure:
1. Achieve >80% code coverage for critical paths
2. Run integration tests in CI/CD pipeline
3. Verify error monitoring captures and reports issues
4. Test TypeScript strict mode compilation
5. Verify automated tests prevent regressions
6. Test code quality gates in deployment pipeline
