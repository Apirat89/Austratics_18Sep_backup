# Task ID: 8
# Title: Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize application performance including image loading, caching strategies, and infrastructure improvements.
# Details:
Implement performance optimizations:

- Optimize Australian background image loading
- Implement caching strategies
- Bundle size optimization
- Set up performance monitoring
- Replace in-memory token storage with Redis
- Optimize database queries and connections
- Implement CDN for static assets

# Test Strategy:
Measure performance improvements:
1. Benchmark page load times before/after optimization
2. Test caching effectiveness with repeated requests
3. Measure bundle size reduction
4. Verify Redis integration for token storage
5. Test database query performance
6. Validate CDN asset delivery
7. Monitor Core Web Vitals scores
