# Task ID: 1
# Title: Domain Registration & DNS Setup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: critical
# Description: Register Australian domain name and configure DNS hosting with proper DNS records for production deployment.
# Details:
Register Australian domain (suggestion: agedcareanalytics.com.au) and set up DNS hosting:

- Register domain with Australian registrar
- Set up DNS hosting with reliable provider
- Configure basic DNS records (A, CNAME, MX)
- Verify domain ownership and propagation
- Document domain management credentials

This is a critical blocking task for production launch as email configuration and hosting depend on having a registered domain.

# Test Strategy:
Verify domain registration by:
1. Confirming domain ownership in registrar dashboard
2. Testing DNS propagation using dig/nslookup tools
3. Verifying A record points to hosting provider
4. Testing domain accessibility via web browser
5. Confirming MX records are properly configured for email
