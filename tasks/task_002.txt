# Description: Configure Resend API for production email delivery with custom domain authentication.
# Details:
Set up email service for password reset functionality:

- Get Resend API key from resend.com
- Add RESEND_API_KEY to production environment variables
- Update email 'from' address in src/lib/email.ts to use custom domain
- Add domain to Resend dashboard
- Configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC DNS records for email authentication
- Test email deliverability and authentication

This enables the password reset functionality which is currently blocked.

# Test Strategy:
Test email configuration by:
1. Verifying Resend API key works in dashboard
2. Testing email sending from custom domain
3. Checking SPF/DKIM/DMARC records via email authentication tools
4. Sending test emails to different providers (Gmail, Outlook)
5. Verifying emails land in inbox (not spam folder)
